## üìñ The Sermon Building Process

### Step 1: Foundation
- Enter Scripture reference
- Describe historical and literary context
- Begin with prayer and communion with God

### Step 2: Cornerstone
- Articulate how Jesus/Gospel connects to the text
- Consider Christ's character and the Gospel message
- Display the majesty of God in Christ

### Step 3: Three Pillars
For each pillar, follow the 8-step process:
1. Read the Text (slow and clear)
2. State the Point (what's the truth?)
3. Explain the Scene (people, need, action, teaching)
4. Draw the Principle (what does this show about God?)
5. Add Velcro (relatable illustration)
6. Connect (restate the point)
7. Challenge (practical, pointed question)
8. Transition Smoothly (link to next section)

### Step 4: Keystone
- Show how Christ unifies all three pillars
- Connect His life, death, resurrection, or Spirit-presence
- Create one cohesive Gospel-centered message

### Step 5: Capstone
- Review the three points clearly
- Call the church to build their lives on this foundation
- Pray for alignment between God's Word and response

## üéØ Success Criteria

Each step includes specific success criteria to ensure quality sermon preparation:
- Foundation: Can describe original context in 2-3 clear sentences
- Cornerstone: Can articulate Gospel connection before outlining
- Pillars: Each flows naturally from text with genuine illustrations
- Keystone: Christ appears as both foundation and unifying element
- Capstone: Conclusion brings unity to the entire sermon
