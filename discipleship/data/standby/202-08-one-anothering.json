It requires showing up when it is inconvenient, telling the truth when it is uncomfortable, forgiving when it is costly, and bearing weight that is not yours to carry. This lesson is about the most demanding and most beautiful part of community life: the \"one another\" commands of the New Testament."

Every single one of them requires proximity - you cannot do them from a distance."
