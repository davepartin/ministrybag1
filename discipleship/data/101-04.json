Now in the Law, Moses commanded us to stone such women. So what do you say?\" This they said to test him, that they might have some charge to bring against him. Jesus bent down and wrote with his finger on the ground. And as they continued to ask him, he stood up and said to them, \"Let him who is without sin among you be the first to throw a stone at her.\" And once more he bent down and wrote on the ground. But when they heard it, they went away one by one, beginning with the older ones, and Jesus was left alone with the woman standing before him. Jesus stood up and said to her, \"Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?\" She said, \"No one, Lord.\" And Jesus said, \"Neither do I condemn you; go, and from now on sin no more.\"",
