  "description": "The Father loves you. The Son redeems you. And now the Spirit lives in you. This lesson introduces the third person of the Trinity - who the Holy Spirit is, what He does in your daily life, and what it means to walk in His power and presence rather than your own strength. This is the primary home for teaching on the person and work of the Spirit - anything about the Spirit that does not fit in 202.08 (Sanctification & the Fruit of the Spirit) belongs here.",
