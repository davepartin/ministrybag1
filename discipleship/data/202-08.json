  "description": "Sanctification is the process - the Fruit of the Spirit is the evidence. This lesson explores how God progressively conforms you to the image of Christ through the Spirit's work, and how the nine fruits of Galatians 5 are the visible proof that the process is happening. Know who you are, then live out who you are.",
