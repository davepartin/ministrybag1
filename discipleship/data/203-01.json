This course is about living on mission in the world God has placed you in. It starts with the most important words Jesus ever said before he left."

A carpenter's shop. Meals with tax collectors. Conversations at wells and in fishing boats. Jesus did not carry out his mission primarily through events or platforms. He carried it out through presence - showing up, noticing people, building trust, and letting the gospel work through everyday relationships. That is the model. You are not supporting someone else's mission from a safe distance. You are sent."
