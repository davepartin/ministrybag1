Nehemiah learns the priest Eliashib gave Tobiah a room in the temple, so he throws out Tobiah's household goods and purifies the rooms, rebukes those neglecting the Levites and breaking the Sabbath, and confronts men who married foreign women, even chasing away a priest married to Sanballat's daughter, and prays God will remember him favorably.",
  "Esther 1": "King Xerxes displays his wealth for 180 days then holds a seven-day banquet for all his officials. When Queen Vashti refuses to come display her beauty at his drunken command, his advisors convince him to depose her and issue a decree that all women must honor their husbands, lest other wives become disobedient.",
  "Esther 2": "Xerxes' attendants propose gathering beautiful virgins and choosing a new queen. Mordecai's cousin Esther, whom he adopted after her parents died, is taken to the palace and wins favor with everyone, especially Hegai the keeper of the women, and after twelve months of beauty treatments, she is brought to the king who loves her above all women and makes her queen, and Mordecai uncovers an assassination plot and Esther reports it to the king.",
  "Esther 3": "King Xerxes honors Haman, and all officials bow to him except Mordecai the Jew. Enraged, Haman plots to destroy all Jews throughout the kingdom, casts lots (purim) to choose a date, and convinces the king to issue an edict authorizing the annihilation of all Jews in one day, plundering their goods, and couriers carry the decree to every province.",
  "Esther 4": "When Mordecai learns of the edict, he tears his clothes, puts on sackcloth, and wails loudly. He sends word to Esther to plead with the king, but she explains approaching the king uninvited means death, and Mordecai responds that perhaps she came to her royal position 'for such a time as this,' and Esther agrees to go after three days of fasting.",
  "Esther 5": "Esther puts on royal robes and stands in the inner court, and when the king sees her, he extends his golden scepter, sparing her life. He offers her up to half his kingdom, but she only requests he and Haman attend a banquet, and at the banquet she invites them to another the next day, and Haman boasts to his family but is enraged that Mordecai still won't bow, and his wife suggests building a gallows to hang Mordecai.",
  "Esther 6": "That night the king cannot sleep and has the chronicles read, discovering Mordecai saved his life but was never rewarded. When Haman arrives to request permission to hang Mordecai, the king asks how to honor someone, and Haman, thinking the king means him, suggests royal robes and a horse, so the king orders Haman to do exactly this for Mordecai, humiliating Haman who returns home in mourning.",
  "Esther 7": "At the second banquet, Esther reveals she is Jewish and pleads for her life and her people's, identifying Haman as the enemy. The king storms out in rage, and when he returns to find Haman falling on Esther's couch begging for mercy, he orders Haman hanged on the very gallows Haman built for Mordecai.",
  "Esther 8": "The king gives Mordecai Haman's position and Esther his estate, but the edict to destroy the Jews still stands. Esther begs the king to revoke it, and he allows her and Mordecai to write a new decree letting Jews defend themselves, which is sent throughout the kingdom in every language, and many people convert to Judaism out of fear of the Jews.",
  "Esther 9": "On the thirteenth day of Adar, when enemies hoped to overpower the Jews, the opposite occurs—the Jews strike down their enemies while officials help them out of fear of Mordecai. In Susa, the Jews kill 500 men plus Haman's ten sons, and the king grants one more day, and throughout the provinces 75,000 enemies die, and Mordecai establishes Purim as an annual celebration of deliverance.",
  "Esther 10": "King Xerxes imposes tribute throughout his empire, and Mordecai the Jew becomes second in rank, working for his people's welfare and speaking up for their security. His acts of power and might are recorded in the annals of the kings of Media and Persia.",
  "Job 1": "Job, a blameless and upright man in Uz, has seven sons, three daughters, and vast wealth. In heaven, Satan challenges God, claiming Job only serves God because of His protection and blessings, so God allows Satan to test Job, and in one day messengers bring news that raiders stole his oxen and donkeys, fire fell from heaven burning his sheep, Chaldeans took his camels, and a windstorm killed all his children, yet Job worships God saying, 'The Lord gave and the Lord has taken away; may the name of the Lord be praised.'",
  "Job 2": "Satan again appears before God, who points to Job's continued integrity despite losing everything. Satan argues that if Job's health is struck, he will curse God, so God allows Satan to afflict Job with painful sores from head to foot, and Job's wife tells him to curse God and die, but Job rebukes her, and three friends—Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar—come to comfort him, sitting in silence for seven days because they see his suffering is very great.",
  "Job 3": "Job finally breaks his silence and curses the day of his birth, wishing he had died in the womb rather than live to see such misery. He questions why God gives life to those in misery and longs for death that doesn't come, expressing the depth of his anguish and suffering.",
  "Job 4": "Eliphaz responds gently, reminding Job of how he has strengthened others, but questions whether innocent people ever perish. He describes a mysterious vision where a spirit declared that no mortal can be more righteous than God, and suggests that those who sow trouble reap it, implying Job must have sinned to suffer so greatly.",
  "Job 5": "Eliphaz continues, declaring that trouble doesn't come from the soil but people are born to it. He encourages Job to appeal to God who does marvelous things, and promises that if Job accepts God's discipline, God will deliver him from six troubles, even seven, and restore him to greater blessing than before.",
  "Job 6": "Job responds that his anguish is so great it outweighs the sand of the seas, and God's arrows have pierced him. He defends his complaint as justified, laments that his friends have proved undependable like seasonal streams that dry up, and asks them to teach him where he has gone wrong rather than assuming he has sinned.",
  "Job 7": "Job continues, describing life as hard service with no rest, his nights full of tossing until dawn, his skin broken and oozing. He questions why God watches him so closely if he's only going to die soon anyway, and asks what his sin is that God targets him and won't leave him alone even long enough to swallow his saliva.",
  "Job 8": "Bildad accuses Job's words of being a blustering wind, insisting God doesn't pervert justice and suggesting Job's children died for their own sins. He argues that God doesn't reject a blameless person, so if Job is pure, God will restore him, but if not, he will perish like godless hypocrites who trust in what proves fragile as a spider's web.",
  "Job 9": "Job agrees no one can be righteous before God, but questions how to contend with One who is infinitely powerful and wise. He describes God's incomprehensible greatness yet laments that God seems to destroy both the blameless and the wicked alike, and there is no mediator between them to lay a hand on both and remove God's rod from him.",
  "Job 10": "Job pours out his complaint freely, asking God why He condemns him and whether it pleases Him to oppress, to favor the wicked while crushing the work of His hands. He questions why God brought him out of the womb only to suffer, asking to be left alone for his few remaining days before he goes to the land of gloom and deep shadow.",
  "Job 11": "Zophar harshly accuses Job of being a talker full of empty words, claiming Job says his beliefs are flawless and he is pure, but insists God knows deceitful people and sees wickedness. He declares that if Job puts away sin and reaches out to God, his life will be brighter than noonday and secure, but the wicked have no escape.",
  "Job 12": "Job responds sarcastically that surely his friends are the people and wisdom will die with them, but he is not inferior and knows as much as they do. He declares that even animals could teach them that God is sovereign over everything, but his friends' proverbs are as worthless as ashes, and he wishes to argue his case directly with God.",
  "Job 13": "Job tells his friends they are worthless physicians who whitewash the truth with lies, and they should be silent because that would be their wisdom. He declares his desire to argue his case before God, knowing that even if God slays him, he will hope in Him, though he wants to know what he has done wrong, asking why God hides His face and treats him as an enemy.",
  "Job 14": "Job reflects on humanity's brief, troubled life like a flower that withers and a shadow that flees, questioning why God would bring charges against such a one. He wishes God would hide him in the grave until His anger passes, then remember him, but laments that unlike a tree that can sprout again when cut down, when a person dies, they don't return.",
  "Job 15": "Eliphaz responds more harshly, accusing Job of filling himself with hot east wind and undermining piety with his words. He argues that even the heavens are not pure in God's sight, how much less humans who drink up evil like water, and describes the fate of the wicked who live in anguish, suggesting this is Job's condition.",
  "Job 16": "Job calls his friends miserable comforters whose speeches are like a torrent of words, saying he could speak like them if positions were reversed. He describes how God has worn him out, torn him in His wrath, and allowed the wicked to strike him on the cheek, yet insists his prayer is pure and his witness is in heaven, and he weeps before God.",
  "Job 17": "Job's spirit is broken, his days cut short, and the grave awaits him, and though mockers surround him, he pleads with God to be his pledge. He laments that his friends have closed their minds to understanding, and though they claim his night will soon be day, he sees darkness approaching, making the grave his home and the worm his family.",
  "Job 18": "Bildad angrily asks when Job will stop his words, accusing him of regarding his friends as cattle. He describes in vivid detail the fate of the wicked—their light goes out, calamity pursues them, terrors startle them, disease eats their skin, they are torn from security, and their memory perishes, suggesting all this applies to Job.",
  "Job 19": "Job responds that his friends have reproached him ten times without shame, and even if he has sinned, it remains his own matter. He describes how God has wronged him, walled up his path, stripped his honor, alienated his family, and made everyone turn against him, and he pleads for pity, but declares confidently: 'I know that my redeemer lives, and that in the end he will stand on the earth. And after my skin has been destroyed, yet in my flesh I will see God.'",
  "Job 20": "Zophar responds with agitation, describing the brief triumph of the wicked who may enjoy pleasure but will perish forever. Though evil is sweet in their mouth and wealth fills their stomach, God will make them vomit it up, their prosperity will not endure, and terrors will overtake them—this is the fate God has appointed for the wicked.",
  "Job 21": "Job counters by observing that the wicked often prosper, their children thrive, their homes are safe, their cattle increase, and they spend their days in wealth without suffering. He questions why, if God judges, the wicked are not punished in their lifetime but often die in comfort and security, making his friends' arguments meaningless.",
  "Job 22": "Eliphaz directly accuses Job of great wickedness—withholding water from the weary, bread from the hungry, sending widows away empty, and crushing orphans—and claims this is why disaster has overtaken him. He urges Job to submit to God, accept instruction, return to the Almighty, and remove wickedness, promising that if he does, God will restore him.",
  "Job 23": "Job wishes he knew where to find God so he could present his case before Him, but God is not in His dwelling place. He knows Job has not departed from God's commands, treasuring His words more than daily bread, yet God does whatever He pleases with him, and understanding this terrifies Job, though God has not silenced him with darkness.",
  "Job 24": "Job questions why the Almighty doesn't set times for judgment when the wicked steal from the poor, push the needy off the path, murder the innocent, and commit adultery under cover of darkness. He observes that though evildoers briefly prosper, they will be brought low, cut off like heads of grain, yet asks who can prove him wrong.",
  "Job 25": "Bildad's brief response declares that dominion and fear belong to God who makes peace in His heights, and questions how a mortal can be righteous before God or one born of woman be pure, since even the moon is not bright and stars are not pure in His eyes, how much less man who is a maggot.",
  "Job 26": "Job mocks Bildad's unhelpful words, asking whose spirit spoke through him. He then describes God's power—He spreads the northern skies over empty space, suspends the earth over nothing, wraps waters in clouds, stirs up the sea, and by His breath the heavens become fair, yet these are merely the outer fringes of His works.",
  "Job 27": "Job vows by the living God who has denied him justice that he will maintain his innocence as long as he lives and never admit his friends are right. He describes the fate awaiting the wicked—their children will face the sword or hunger, their widows will not weep, and though they heap up silver and clothes, the righteous will wear them.",
  "Job 28": "Job describes humanity's impressive ability to mine precious metals and gems from the earth's depths, but asks where wisdom can be found, for it is hidden from living creatures and cannot be purchased with gold or jewels. Only God understands the way to wisdom, for He looks to the ends of the earth, and He said to humanity: 'The fear of the Lord—that is wisdom, and to shun evil is understanding.'",
  "Job 29": "Job longs for the months when God watched over him, when his lamp shone above his head and he walked through darkness by God's light. He recalls when he was honored in the city gate, helped the poor and needy, broke the fangs of the wicked, and lived like a king among his troops, and everyone listened to his counsel.",
  "Job 30": "Now young men whose fathers Job would have disdained mock him, and outcasts spit in his face. God has afflicted him terribly—His fury pursues him, nights of pain pierce his bones, and terrors overwhelm him. He cries to God but receives no answer, and stands up in the assembly pleading for help, yet expected good but evil came, light but darkness arrived.",
  "Job 31": "Job makes a final defense of his integrity through a series of oaths, declaring if he has lusted, lied, committed adultery, mistreated servants, ignored the poor, trusted in wealth, rejoiced at enemies' misfortune, or hidden sin like Adam, then let him be punished. He insists on his innocence and longs for the Almighty to answer him, willing to wear any accusation like a crown if someone could prove wrongdoing.",
  "Job 32": "After Job's three friends stop answering because Job is righteous in his own eyes, Elihu becomes angry—at Job for justifying himself rather than God, and at the three friends for condemning Job without proving him wrong. Elihu, younger than the others, waited to speak out of respect for age, but now declares he is full of words and must speak, and he will show no partiality.",
  "Job 33": "Elihu addresses Job directly, saying he will speak uprightly from sincere motives. He rebukes Job for claiming to be pure and without sin, saying God has no obligation to answer humans, and He speaks in various ways though people may not perceive it—through dreams, suffering, and angelic intervention—to turn them from wrongdoing and preserve them from death.",
  "Job 34": "Elihu appeals to the wise men listening, arguing that Job speaks without knowledge when he says God denies him justice. He declares it's unthinkable that God would do wrong, for He governs all people impartially, doesn't need to investigate further before judging, and has no obligation to explain His ways to humans who charge Him with injustice.",
  "Job 35": "Elihu questions Job's claim to be more righteous than God, asking what Job gains by being sinless or what God gains if Job sins. He explains that human righteousness or wickedness only affects other humans, not God, and when people cry out in affliction but don't seek God, He doesn't answer because of their pride and empty cries.",
  "Job 36": "Elihu asks Job to wait while he speaks more on God's behalf, saying God is mighty yet doesn't despise anyone. He explains that God uses suffering to speak to people, to draw them from distress, warn them about sin, and if they listen and serve Him, they will prosper, but if not, they will perish, and he describes God's power in thunder, rain, and storms.",
  "Job 37": "Elihu continues describing God's awesome power in storms—thunder, lightning, snow, and ice—that accomplish His purposes whether for judgment or to show His love. He challenges Job to consider God's wonders, questions whether Job can explain the clouds or lightning, and asks how Job can confront God when he cannot even look at the sun, concluding that God is exalted beyond our understanding.",
  "Job 38": "The Lord answers Job out of the storm, challenging him: 'Who is this that obscures my plans with words without knowledge?' God asks Job where he was when He laid the earth's foundations, set its dimensions, and made the sea, then questions whether Job has comprehended the earth's vast expanses, death's gates, light's dwelling, or snow's storehouses, overwhelming Job with questions about creation he cannot answer.",
  "Job 39": "God continues questioning Job about wild animals—do you know when mountain goats give birth, can you provide food for lions, does the hawk take flight by your wisdom, does the eagle soar at your command? He describes the ostrich's foolishness, the horse's strength in battle, and the hawk's flight, demonstrating His sovereign care and design throughout creation.",
  "Job 40": "God asks if Job who contends with Him will correct Him, and Job covers his mouth, admitting he has no answer. God continues, asking if Job has an arm like His, then describes Behemoth, a powerful creature that moves with majesty, eats grass like an ox, whose strength is in its loins, and can drink up rivers, demonstrating God's creative power over the mightiest creatures.",
  "Job 41": "God describes Leviathan, an untamable creature no one can capture with hooks or pierce its hide with harpoons, breathing fire and smoke, with scales so tight no air can pass between them, thrashing making the depths churn like a boiling pot, nothing on earth its equal, looking down on all that are haughty—it is king over all that are proud.",
  "Job 42": "Job responds in humble repentance, acknowledging he spoke of things he didn't understand, that his ears had heard of God but now his eyes have seen Him, and he despises himself and repents in dust and ashes. God rebukes Job's three friends for not speaking truth about Him like Job did, commands them to sacrifice and have Job pray for them, then restores Job's fortunes, giving him twice as much as before—14,000 sheep, 6,000 camels, 1,000 yoke of oxen, 1,000 donkeys, seven sons and three daughters, and 140 more years of life.",
  "Psalm 1": "This wisdom psalm contrasts two paths—the blessed person who delights in God's law and meditates on it day and night, becoming like a fruitful tree by streams of water, versus the wicked who are like chaff blown away by the wind. The righteous will prosper while the way of the wicked will perish.",
  "Psalm 2": "This royal psalm celebrates God's anointed king in Zion and warns the nations not to rebel against the Lord and His Messiah. Kings are urged to serve the Lord with fear and submit to the Son, for blessed are all who take refuge in Him.",

  "Psalm 4": "David calls on God to answer him in his distress and rebukes those who turn his glory into shame by loving delusions.

  "Psalm 5": "David brings his morning prayer to God, asking Him to listen to his cry for help and lead him in righteousness because of his enemies.

  "Psalm 11": "When advised to flee like a bird to the mountains because the wicked are drawing their bows, David refuses because the Lord is his refuge.

  "Psalm 12": "David cries out for help because the faithful have vanished and everyone lies to their neighbor with flattering but deceptive lips.

  "Psalm 119:137-144": "The Lord is righteous and His laws are fully trustworthy. Though the psalmist is lowly and despised, he does not forget God's precepts, for His righteousness is everlasting and His law is truth, and understanding God's statutes gives him life.",
  "Psalm 119:145-152": "The psalmist calls with all his heart for God to answer and save him that he may keep His statutes. He rises before dawn and cries for help, putting his hope in God's word, and his eyes stay open through the watches of the night that he may meditate on His promises.",
  "Psalm 119:153-160": "The psalmist asks God to look on his suffering and deliver him, to defend his cause and redeem him, and to preserve his life according to His promise. He is far from the wicked who do not seek His decrees, but all God's words are true and His righteous laws are eternal.",
  "Psalm 119:161-168": "Rulers persecute the psalmist without cause, but his heart trembles at God's word. He rejoices in His promise like one who finds great spoil, loves His law and praises Him seven times a day, and great peace have those who love His law—nothing can make them stumble.",
  "Psalm 119:169-176": "May the psalmist's cry come before God and may he understand according to His word. His lips will overflow with praise because God teaches him His decrees, and his tongue will sing of His word for all His commands are righteous, yet he has strayed like a lost sheep—may God seek His servant who has not forgotten His commands.",
  "Psalm 120": "In distress the psalmist cries to the Lord for deliverance from lying lips and deceitful tongues. He asks what will be done to the deceitful tongue, and laments that he dwells among those who hate peace—when he speaks of peace, they are for war.",
  "Psalm 121": "This pilgrimage psalm declares that help comes from the Lord, Maker of heaven and earth, who will not let your foot slip and watches over you. The Lord is your keeper who shades you at your right hand, the sun will not harm you by day nor the moon by night, and the Lord will watch over your coming and going both now and forevermore.",
  "Psalm 122": "The psalmist rejoices when people say 'Let us go to the house of the Lord,' for Jerusalem is built as a city closely united where the tribes go up to praise the Lord's name and thrones for judgment stand. He prays for peace within Jerusalem's walls and security within her citadels.",
  "Psalm 123": "The psalmist lifts up his eyes to God enthroned in heaven, looking to Him as servants look to their master's hand. He appeals for mercy, for they have endured much contempt from the proud and ridicule from the arrogant.",
  "Psalm 124": "If the Lord had not been on Israel's side when people attacked them, they would have swallowed them alive when their anger flared. The flood would have engulfed them and the torrent swept them away, but praise be to the Lord who has not let them be torn by their enemies' teeth—they have escaped like a bird from the fowler's snare.",
  "Psalm 125": "Those who trust in the Lord are like Mount Zion which cannot be shaken but endures forever, and as mountains surround Jerusalem, so the Lord surrounds His people both now and forevermore. The scepter of the wicked will not remain over the land, but peace be on Israel.",
  "Psalm 126": "When the Lord restored the fortunes of Zion, it was like a dream and mouths were filled with laughter and tongues with songs of joy. The psalmist prays for God to restore their fortunes again like streams in the Negev, for those who sow with tears will reap with songs of joy, and those who go out weeping carrying seed will return with songs of joy carrying sheaves.",
  "Psalm 127": "Unless the Lord builds the house, the builders labor in vain, and unless the Lord watches over the city, the guards stand watch in vain. It is vain to rise early and stay up late toiling for food, for God grants sleep to those He loves, and children are a heritage from the Lord—blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them.",
  "Psalm 128": "Blessed are all who fear the Lord and walk in obedience to Him, for they will eat the fruit of their labor, their wife will be like a fruitful vine and children like olive shoots around the table. Thus is the one blessed who fears the Lord, and may you see the prosperity of Jerusalem all the days of your life.",
  "Psalm 129": "Israel testifies that they have been greatly oppressed from youth, yet they have not prevailed against them. Though plowmen plowed on Israel's back making long furrows, the Lord has cut them free from the cords of the wicked, and may all who hate Zion be turned back in shame.",
  "Psalm 130": "Out of the depths the psalmist cries to the Lord, asking Him to hear his voice and listen to his cry for mercy. If the Lord kept a record of sins, who could stand? But with Him is forgiveness, therefore He is feared, and the psalmist waits for the Lord more than watchmen wait for the morning, for with the Lord is unfailing love and full redemption.",
  "Psalm 131": "David's heart is not proud and his eyes are not haughty—he does not concern himself with great matters or things too wonderful for him. But he has calmed and quieted himself like a weaned child with its mother, and Israel should put their hope in the Lord both now and forevermore.",
  "Psalm 132": "Remember David's hardships, how he swore not to rest until he found a dwelling place for the Mighty One of Jacob.

The Lord does whatever pleases Him in heaven and earth, and He struck down firstborn of Egypt, sent signs and wonders, and struck down many nations to give their land as an inheritance to Israel, but the idols of the nations are silver and gold with mouths that cannot speak.",
  "Psalm 136": "Give thanks to the Lord for His love endures forever—this refrain appears in all 26 verses celebrating God who alone does great wonders, made the heavens and earth, divided the Red Sea, led Israel through the wilderness, struck down great kings, and gave their land as an inheritance. He remembers us in our low estate and frees us from our enemies.",
  "Psalm 137": "By the rivers of Babylon the exiles sat and wept when they remembered Zion, hanging their harps on the willows when captors demanded songs. How could they sing the Lord's song in a foreign land?

  "Psalm 138": "David praises God with all his heart, bowing toward His holy temple and giving thanks for His unfailing love and faithfulness.

  "Psalm 139": "David marvels that God has searched him and knows him completely—when he sits, rises, and his thoughts from afar. Where can he flee from God's presence? Even in the darkness God sees, for the darkness is as light to Him, and he was fearfully and wonderfully made in his mother's womb where God saw his unformed body and ordained all his days before one of them came to be.",
  "Psalm 140": "David cries out for rescue from evil people who devise violence, make their tongues sharp as serpents, and plan to trip his feet. He asks God to keep the wicked from their desires, let burning coals fall on them, and uphold the cause of the poor and needy, for the righteous will surely give thanks and the upright will live in His presence.",
  "Psalm 141": "David calls to the Lord urgently, asking Him to accept his prayer as incense and the lifting of his hands as the evening sacrifice. He prays for God to set a guard over his mouth, keep him from being drawn to evil deeds, and let the righteous strike him in kindness rather than let his head be anointed with the oil of the wicked.",
  "Psalm 142": "In the cave David pours out his complaint, telling of his trouble to the Lord, for when his spirit grows faint, God knows his way.

  "Psalm 143": "David pleads for the Lord to hear his prayer in His faithfulness and righteousness, not to bring judgment on His servant, for the enemy pursues and crushes him to the ground making him dwell in darkness. He remembers the days of long ago, meditates on God's works, spreads out his hands to Him like a parched land thirsting for water, asking God to teach him to do His will.",
  "Psalm 144": "David praises the Lord his Rock who trains his hands for war and fingers for battle, and he marvels that God cares about mere mortals. He asks God to part the heavens and come down, scatter His enemies with arrows of lightning, and reach down from on high to deliver him, that their sons may be like plants and daughters like pillars, their barns full and sheep numbering in the thousands.",
  "Psalm 145": "David exalts God the King, declaring he will praise His name forever, for the Lord is great and greatly to be praised.

  "Psalm 146": "Praise the Lord, O my soul, for blessed is the one whose help is the God of Jacob, the Maker of heaven and earth who remains faithful forever.

  "Psalm 147": "Praise the Lord who rebuilds Jerusalem, gathers Israel's exiles, heals the brokenhearted, and binds up their wounds. He determines the number of stars and calls them each by name, yet He delights in those who fear Him and put their hope in His unfailing love, and He sends His word to the earth and His commands run swiftly.",
  "Psalm 148": "Praise the Lord from the heavens and heights, all His angels and heavenly hosts, sun and moon and shining stars, for He commanded and they were created.

  "Psalm 149": "Sing to the Lord a new song and praise in the assembly of the faithful, for the Lord takes delight in His people and crowns the humble with victory.

  "Psalm 150": "Praise the Lord in His sanctuary and mighty heavens for His acts of power and surpassing greatness. Praise Him with trumpet, harp, lyre, tambourine, dancing, strings, pipe, and resounding cymbals—let everything that has breath praise the Lord!",
  "Proverbs 1": "Solomon begins with the purpose of proverbs—to gain wisdom, instruction, and understanding for living skillfully. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge, and he warns his son to avoid the enticement of sinners who lurk to ambush the innocent, for wisdom calls aloud in the streets warning that those who reject her will eat the fruit of their ways.",
  "Proverbs 2": "If you accept wisdom and store up commands, turning your ear to wisdom and searching for it like silver, then you will understand the fear of the Lord and find the knowledge of God. Wisdom will save you from the ways of wicked men and the adulterous woman, and you will walk in the ways of the good and keep to the paths of the righteous.",
  "Proverbs 3": "Do not forget wisdom's teaching but keep commands in your heart, for they will prolong your life many years. Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to Him and He will make your paths straight, and blessed is the one who finds wisdom, for she is more precious than rubies.",
  "Proverbs 4": "Solomon recalls how his father taught him to get wisdom above all else, to guard his heart for it is the wellspring of life, and to keep his eyes straight ahead on the path of the righteous that shines ever brighter. He warns to avoid the path of the wicked which is like deep darkness where they stumble and don't know what makes them fall.",
  "Proverbs 5": "Solomon warns against the seductive words of the adulteress whose lips drip honey but end in bitterness, leading down to death. Instead, rejoice in the wife of your youth, be captivated by her love, and drink water from your own cistern, for a man's ways are in full view of the Lord who weighs all his paths.",
  "Proverbs 6": "Warning against becoming surety for another's debt, Solomon describes the sluggard who should learn from the ant's diligence. He lists seven things the Lord hates including haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood, and vividly warns that adultery will cost a man everything—jealousy arouses a husband's fury and he will show no mercy.",
  "Proverbs 7": "Solomon describes watching a young man void of understanding follow an adulteress like an ox going to slaughter, not knowing it will cost him his life. He urges his son to keep his commands and bind them on his fingers, for her house is the highway to the grave, leading down to the chambers of death.",
  "Proverbs 8": "Wisdom calls out from the highest points, offering prudence, knowledge, and sound judgment, for her instruction is more valuable than silver and gold. She was there when God established the heavens, marked out the foundations of the earth, and whoever finds her finds life and receives favor from the Lord, but those who fail to find her harm themselves.",
  "Proverbs 9": "Wisdom has built her house with seven pillars and prepared a feast, sending out invitations to the simple to leave their ways and gain understanding. In contrast, the woman Folly sits at the door of her house calling to passersby, offering stolen water and food eaten in secret, but her guests don't know that the dead are there and her guests are in the depths of the grave.",
  "Proverbs 10": "A wise son brings joy to his father but a foolish son brings grief to his mother. The tongue of the righteous is choice silver while the heart of the wicked is of little value, hatred stirs up conflict but love covers over all wrongs, and the mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence.",
  "Proverbs 11": "The Lord detests dishonest scales but delights in accurate weights. When pride comes, disgrace follows, but with humility comes wisdom, and the righteousness of the upright delivers them while the unfaithful are trapped by evil desires. Whoever is kind to the poor lends to the Lord, and a generous person will prosper while whoever refreshes others will be refreshed.",
  "Proverbs 12": "Whoever loves discipline loves knowledge but whoever hates correction is stupid. The Lord detects lying lips but delights in people who are trustworthy, and the words of the reckless pierce like swords but the tongue of the wise brings healing. Truthful lips endure forever but a lying tongue lasts only a moment.",
  "Proverbs 13": "A wise son heeds his father's instruction but a mocker does not respond to rebukes. Walk with the wise and become wise, but a companion of fools suffers harm, and whoever spares the rod hates their children but the one who loves them is careful to discipline. The righteous eat to their heart's content but the stomach of the wicked goes hungry.",
  "Proverbs 14": "The wise woman builds her house but the foolish one tears it down with her own hands. Where there are no oxen, the manger is empty, but from the strength of an ox come abundant harvests, and there is a way that appears right to a man but in the end it leads to death. A patient person has great understanding but one who is quick-tempered displays folly.",
  "Proverbs 15": "A gentle answer turns away wrath but a harsh word stirs up anger. The tongue of the wise adorns knowledge but the mouth of the fool gushes folly, and the eyes of the Lord are everywhere keeping watch on the wicked and the good. Better a small serving of vegetables with love than a fattened calf with hatred, and a person's wisdom yields patience and it is to one's glory to overlook an offense.",
  "Proverbs 16": "To humans belong the plans of the heart but from the Lord comes the proper answer of the tongue. Commit to the Lord whatever you do and He will establish your plans, and the fear of the Lord is the fountain of life turning a person from the snares of death. Better a little with righteousness than much gain with injustice, and gray hair is a crown of splendor attained in the way of righteousness.",
  "Proverbs 17": "Better a dry crust with peace and quiet than a house full of feasting with strife. A friend loves at all times and a brother is born for a time of adversity, and whoever mocks the poor shows contempt for their Maker. Children's children are a crown to the aged and parents are the pride of their children, and a cheerful heart is good medicine but a crushed spirit dries up the bones.",
  "Proverbs 18": "An unfriendly person pursues selfish ends and against all sound judgment starts quarrels. The tongue has the power of life and death and those who love it will eat its fruit, and he who finds a wife finds what is good and receives favor from the Lord. The name of the Lord is a fortified tower where the righteous run to it and are safe.",
  "Proverbs 19": "Better the poor whose walk is blameless than a fool whose lips are perverse. A hot-tempered person must pay the penalty, for if you rescue them you will have to do it again, and whoever is kind to the poor lends to the Lord and He will reward them for what they have done. Many are the plans in a person's heart but it is the Lord's purpose that prevails.",
  "Proverbs 20": "Wine is a mocker and beer a brawler, and whoever is led astray by them is not wise. It is to one's honor to avoid strife but every fool is quick to quarrel, and even small children are known by their actions and whether their conduct is pure and right. The glory of young men is their strength and gray hair the splendor of the old.",
  "Proverbs 21": "In the Lord's hand the king's heart is a stream of water that He channels toward all who please Him. A person may think their own ways are right but the Lord weighs the heart, and to do what is right and just is more acceptable to the Lord than sacrifice. The horse is made ready for the day of battle but victory rests with the Lord.",
  "Proverbs 22": "A good name is more desirable than great riches and to be esteemed is better than silver or gold. The rich rule over the poor and the borrower is slave to the lender, and start children off on the way they should go and even when old they will not turn from it. Do not exploit the poor because they are poor or crush the needy in court, for the Lord will take up their case.",
  "Proverbs 23": "When you sit to dine with a ruler, note well what is before you and put a knife to your throat if you are given to gluttony. Do not wear yourself out to get rich but have the wisdom to show restraint, and do not move an ancient boundary stone or encroach on the fields of the fatherless. Apply your heart to instruction and your ears to words of knowledge.",
  "Proverbs 24": "Do not envy the wicked or desire their company, for their hearts plot violence and their lips talk about making trouble. By wisdom a house is built and through understanding it is established, and through knowledge its rooms are filled with rare and beautiful treasures. If you faint in the day of trouble, how small is your strength!",
  "Proverbs 25": "These are more proverbs of Solomon compiled by Hezekiah's men. Like apples of gold in settings of silver is a ruling rightly given, and like a snow-cooled drink at harvest time is a trustworthy messenger. If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat and if thirsty give him water to drink, for you will heap burning coals on his head and the Lord will reward you.",
  "Proverbs 26": "Like snow in summer or rain in harvest, honor is not fitting for a fool. Do not answer a fool according to his folly or you will be like him yourself, but answer a fool according to his folly or he will be wise in his own eyes. Like a maniac shooting flaming arrows of death is one who deceives their neighbor and says 'I was only joking!'",
  "Proverbs 27": "Do not boast about tomorrow for you do not know what a day may bring. Let someone else praise you and not your own mouth, and wounds from a friend can be trusted but an enemy multiplies kisses. As iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another, and whoever tends a fig tree will eat its fruit, and whoever protects their master will be honored.",
  "Proverbs 28": "The wicked flee though no one pursues but the righteous are as bold as a lion. When the righteous thrive, the people rejoice, but when the wicked rule, the people groan, and whoever conceals their sins does not prosper but whoever confesses and renounces them finds mercy. Whoever increases wealth by taking interest or profit from the poor amasses it for another who will be kind to the poor.",
  "Proverbs 29": "Whoever remains stiff-necked after many rebukes will suddenly be destroyed without remedy. When the righteous thrive the people rejoice, but when the wicked rule the people groan, and discipline your children and they will give you peace and bring you the delights you desire. Where there is no revelation people cast off restraint, but blessed is the one who heeds wisdom's instruction.",
  "Proverbs 30": "Agur son of Jakeh declares that every word of God is flawless and He is a shield to those who take refuge in Him. He asks God not to give him poverty or riches but only his daily bread, lest he become full and deny God or become poor and steal, dishonoring God's name. He describes four things that are never satisfied and four things that are small yet extremely wise.",
  "Proverbs 31": "King Lemuel's mother teaches him not to spend his strength on women or vigor on those who ruin kings, but to speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves and defend the rights of the poor and needy. The chapter ends with the famous description of the wife of noble character who is worth far more than rubies—she brings her husband good, works with eager hands, provides for her family, extends her hands to the poor, and her children call her blessed.",
  "Ecclesiastes 1": "The Teacher declares 'Meaningless! Meaningless! Everything is meaningless!' as generations come and go but the earth remains forever. All things are wearisome and there is nothing new under the sun, and the Teacher devoted himself to study and explore by wisdom all that is done under the heavens—what a heavy burden God has laid on mankind! For with much wisdom comes much sorrow and the more knowledge, the more grief.",
  "Ecclesiastes 2": "The Teacher tested pleasure, laughter, wine, and great projects—building houses, planting vineyards and gardens, acquiring servants and possessions—amassing silver and gold and becoming greater than anyone before in Jerusalem. Yet when he surveyed all his hands had done, everything was meaningless, a chasing after the wind, and the wise and the fool both share the same fate, so he hated life and all his toil under the sun.",
  "Ecclesiastes 3": "There is a time for everything and a season for every activity under the heavens—a time to be born and to die, to plant and uproot, to kill and heal, to tear down and build, to weep and laugh, to mourn and dance. God has made everything beautiful in its time and set eternity in the human heart, yet people cannot fathom what God has done from beginning to end.",
  "Ecclesiastes 4": "The Teacher observed the oppression under the sun and saw the tears of the oppressed with no comforter, and considered that the dead are better off than the living and better than both is the one who has never been born. He saw that all toil springs from rivalry, and two are better than one for if either falls down, one can help the other up, and a cord of three strands is not quickly broken.",
  "Ecclesiastes 5": "Guard your steps when you go to the house of God and go near to listen rather than offer the sacrifice of fools who do not know they do wrong. Do not be quick with your mouth or hasty in your heart to utter anything before God, and when you make a vow to God, do not delay to fulfill it. Whoever loves money never has enough, and as goods increase so do those who consume them, and what benefit are they to the owners except to feast their eyes on them?",
  "Ecclesiastes 6": "The Teacher observed an evil: a person to whom God gives wealth and possessions and honor but does not grant the ability to enjoy them—a stranger enjoys them instead, which is meaningless and a grievous evil. Even if a person lives a thousand years twice over but fails to enjoy prosperity, do not all go to the same place? All human toil is for the mouth yet the appetite is never satisfied.",
  "Ecclesiastes 7": "A good name is better than fine perfume and the day of death better than the day of birth. It is better to go to a house of mourning than to a house of feasting, and sorrow is better than laughter because a sad face is good for the heart. Do not be over-righteous or over-wise, and do not be over-wicked or a fool—why die before your time? Wisdom makes one wise person more powerful than ten rulers in a city.",
  "Ecclesiastes 8": "Who is like the wise? Who knows the explanation of things? A person's wisdom brightens their face and changes its hard appearance. Obey the king's command because you took an oath before God, and although the wicked may live long, it will not go well with them because they do not fear God, yet this too is meaningless—the righteous get what the wicked deserve and the wicked get what the righteous deserve.",
  "Ecclesiastes 9": "The same destiny overtakes all—the righteous and the wicked, the good and the bad, the clean and the unclean, and no one knows when their hour will come. Go, eat your food with gladness and drink your wine with a joyful heart, for God has already approved what you do, and enjoy life with your wife whom you love all the days of your meaningless life, for that is your lot in life and in your toilsome labor under the sun.",
  "Ecclesiastes 10": "As dead flies give perfume a bad smell, so a little folly outweighs wisdom and honor. The heart of the wise inclines to the right but the heart of the fool to the left, and even as fools walk along the road they lack sense and show everyone how stupid they are. If a snake bites before it is charmed, the charmer receives no fee, and words from the mouth of the wise are gracious but fools are consumed by their own lips.",
  "Ecclesiastes 11": "Ship your grain across the sea and after many days you may receive a return. Whoever watches the wind will not plant and whoever looks at the clouds will not reap, so sow your seed in the morning and at evening let your hands not be idle. Light is sweet and it pleases the eyes to see the sun, so if people live many years let them rejoice in them all, but remember the days of darkness will be many.",
  "Ecclesiastes 12": "Remember your Creator in the days of your youth before the days of trouble come and years approach when you will say 'I find no pleasure in them,' before the silver cord is severed and the golden bowl is broken. Fear God and keep His commandments, for this is the duty of all mankind, for God will bring every deed into judgment including every hidden thing whether good or evil.",
  "Song of Solomon 1": "The bride longs for her beloved's kisses which are more delightful than wine, and though her skin is darkened by the sun, she is lovely like the tents of Kedar. She asks where he grazes his flock at midday, and he tells her she is the most beautiful among women, comparing her to a mare among Pharaoh's chariot horses and praising her cheeks and neck adorned with jewels.",
  "Song of Solomon 2": "The beloved is like a rose of Sharon and lily of the valleys, and she sits in his shade with great delight, his banner over her being love. She charges the daughters of Jerusalem not to arouse or awaken love until it so desires, and her beloved is like a young stag leaping across the mountains, calling her to arise and come away, for winter is past and flowers appear on the earth.",
  "Song of Solomon 3": "All night long the bride searches for the one her heart loves, going through the streets seeking him until she finds him and brings him to her mother's house. She charges the daughters not to arouse love until it so desires, and describes her beloved coming from the wilderness like a column of smoke in a royal wedding procession, his carriage crafted by King Solomon with sixty warriors attending it.",
  "Song of Solomon 4": "The groom declares his bride is altogether beautiful with no flaw in her, praising her eyes as doves, her hair like a flock of goats, teeth like newly shorn sheep, lips like scarlet ribbon, and temples like halves of a pomegranate. She is a garden locked up, a spring enclosed, a sealed fountain, and he calls for the north and south winds to blow on his garden that its fragrance may spread.",
  "Song of Solomon 5": "The groom has come into his garden and gathered myrrh and spices, but when the bride opens the door, her beloved has turned away. She searches for him through the city where the watchmen beat her, and the daughters ask what is so special about her beloved—she describes his head as finest gold, his body like polished ivory, his legs like pillars of marble, and he is altogether lovely.",
  "Song of Solomon 6": "The daughters ask where the beloved has gone, and the bride says he has gone down to his garden. Her beloved declares she is beautiful as Timnah, lovely as Jerusalem, majestic as troops with banners, and sixty queens and eighty concubines cannot compare to her—she is his perfect one, the only daughter of her mother, and the queens and concubines praise her.",
  "Song of Solomon 7": "The beloved praises his bride's feet in sandals, her graceful legs, navel like a rounded goblet never lacking blended wine, waist like a mound of wheat, breasts like fawns, neck like an ivory tower, and head crowning her like Mount Carmel. She invites him to go to the vineyards early in the morning to see if the vines have budded and pomegranates are in bloom, where she will give him her love.",
  "Song of Solomon 8": "The bride wishes her beloved were like a brother so she could kiss him in public without contempt, and she asks to be placed like a seal over his heart, for love is as strong as death and its jealousy as unyielding as the grave. Many waters cannot quench love nor rivers sweep it away, and if one were to give all their wealth for love, it would be utterly scorned.",
  "Isaiah 1": "Isaiah son of Amoz sees visions concerning Judah and Jerusalem during the reigns of four kings. God laments that the ox knows its master but Israel does not know Him—the sinful nation is loaded with guilt, rebelling children who have forsaken the Lord. Though they offer countless sacrifices and prayers, God will not listen because their hands are full of blood—stop doing wrong, learn to do right, seek justice, defend the oppressed, and though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow.",
  "Isaiah 2": "In the last days the mountain of the Lord's temple will be established as highest of mountains, and all nations will stream to it to be taught God's ways and walk in His paths. He will judge between nations and settle disputes, they will beat swords into plowshares and spears into pruning hooks, and nation will not take up sword against nation nor train for war anymore, so come house of Jacob and walk in the light of the Lord.",
  "Isaiah 3": "The Lord is about to take from Jerusalem and Judah both supply and support—food, water, leaders, prophets, and elders—giving boys as their officials and children to rule over them. The people will oppress each other and show no respect for elders, and the Lord declares that the women of Zion are haughty, walking with outstretched necks and flirting eyes, so instead of fragrance there will be a stench and instead of beauty, branding.",
  "Isaiah 4": "In that day seven women will take hold of one man saying 'We will eat our own food and provide our own clothes; only let us be called by your name to take away our disgrace.' The Branch of the Lord will be beautiful and glorious, the fruit of the land the pride and glory of Israel's survivors, and God will create over Mount Zion a cloud of smoke by day and a glow of flaming fire by night—a canopy of glory over all.",
  "Isaiah 5": "Isaiah sings about his loved one's vineyard that he cultivated but it yielded only bad fruit, so he will take away its hedge and break down its wall. The vineyard of the Lord is Israel whom He looked for justice but saw bloodshed, for righteousness but heard cries of distress. Woe to those who add house to house and field to field, who call evil good and good evil, who are wise in their own eyes, for the Lord's anger burns against His people.",
  "Isaiah 6": "In the year King Uzziah died, Isaiah saw the Lord seated on a throne high and exalted with seraphs calling 'Holy, holy, holy is the Lord Almighty; the whole earth is full of his glory.' Isaiah cried out 'Woe to me! I am ruined! For I am a man of unclean lips,' but a seraph touched his lips with a live coal, atoning for his sin, and when the Lord asked 'Whom shall I send?' Isaiah said 'Here am I. Send me!'",
  "Isaiah 7": "When Aram and Israel march against Jerusalem, the Lord tells Ahaz through Isaiah not to fear these two smoldering stubs of firewood, and offers him a sign. When Ahaz refuses, Isaiah declares the Lord Himself will give a sign: 'The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and will call him Immanuel' (God with us), yet because of Ahaz's unbelief, Assyria will devastate the land.",
  "Isaiah 8": "Isaiah records on a scroll 'Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz' (quick to plunder, swift to spoil) as a sign that Assyria will carry off Damascus and Samaria's wealth before the boy can say 'Father' or 'Mother.' The Lord warns not to call conspiracy everything this people calls conspiracy, but to regard the Lord Almighty as holy, and He will be a stone that causes people to stumble and a trap for Jerusalem's inhabitants.",
  "Isaiah 9": "The people walking in darkness have seen a great light, for to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government will be on His shoulders, and He will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace, and His kingdom will have no end. Yet the Lord's anger burns against Israel for their pride and arrogance, and His hand is still upraised to strike.",
  "Isaiah 10": "Woe to those who make unjust laws and deprive the poor of their rights, for what will you do on the day of reckoning when disaster comes from afar? Though God sends Assyria to punish His people, Assyria's king doesn't intend this but plans to destroy many nations, so when the Lord finishes His work against Mount Zion, He will punish Assyria's arrogant boasting, and a remnant of Israel will truly rely on the Lord.",
  "Isaiah 11": "A shoot will come up from the stump of Jesse and a Branch from his roots will bear fruit—the Spirit of the Lord will rest on Him with wisdom, understanding, counsel, might, knowledge, and the fear of the Lord. He will judge righteously, strike the earth with the rod of His mouth, and with the breath of His lips slay the wicked, and the wolf will live with the lamb, the leopard lie down with the goat, for the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea.",
  "Isaiah 12": "In that day you will say: 'I will praise you, Lord. Although you were angry with me, your anger has turned away and you have comforted me.' Surely God is my salvation; I will trust and not be afraid, and with joy you will draw water from the wells of salvation. Shout aloud and sing for joy, people of Zion, for great is the Holy One of Israel among you.",
  "Isaiah 13": "Isaiah prophesies concerning Babylon: the Lord is mustering an army for war, bringing warriors to carry out His wrath. The day of the Lord is coming—cruel, with wrath and fierce anger—to make the land desolate and destroy its sinners, for the stars will not show their light, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and Babylon, the jewel of kingdoms, will be overthrown by God like Sodom and Gomorrah.",
  "Isaiah 14": "The Lord will have compassion on Jacob and settle them in their own land again, and when He gives them relief from suffering, they will take up this taunt against Babylon's king: 'How the oppressor has come to an end!' Isaiah describes the king of Babylon cast down to the realm of the dead, mocked for his fall from heaven like a morning star, and Assyria will be broken in God's land and its yoke lifted from Israel's shoulders.",
  "Isaiah 15": "An oracle concerning Moab declares that Ar and Kir are ruined, destroyed in a night. Moab wails over Nebo and Medeba with every head shaved and every beard cut off, wearing sackcloth on the roofs and in the streets, and their hearts cry out over their fugitives who flee to Zoar.",
  "Isaiah 16": "Isaiah urges Moab to send lambs as tribute to the ruler in Jerusalem and provide shade and shelter for Judah's fugitives. He prophesies that a throne will be established in love in David's tent—one who judges seeks justice and is swift to do righteousness—but Moab's pride will be brought down, and within three years Moab's splendor will become contempt.",
  "Isaiah 17": "An oracle concerning Damascus declares it will cease to be a city and become a heap of ruins, and the glory of Jacob will fade because they forgot the God of their salvation. Though they plant pleasant plants, the harvest will be a heap of ruins in a day of disease and incurable pain, and God will rebuke the nations so they flee far away, chased like chaff before the wind.",
  "Isaiah 18": "Woe to the land of whirring wings along the rivers of Cush that sends envoys by sea in papyrus boats—go swift messengers! The Lord says He will look on from His dwelling place quietly, and at harvest time He will cut off the shoots with pruning knives, leaving them for mountain birds and wild animals, and then gifts will be brought to the Lord from this tall and smooth-skinned people.",
  "Isaiah 19": "An oracle concerning Egypt: The Lord rides on a swift cloud into Egypt making idols tremble, and He will hand Egyptians over to a harsh master. The Nile will dry up, waters fail, and officials will become fools, but in that day there will be an altar to the Lord in Egypt, and the Lord will strike Egypt with a plague then heal them, and Egypt will be a blessing on the earth.",
  "Isaiah 20": "In the year the supreme commander sent by Sargon king of Assyria came to Ashdod and captured it, the Lord said through Isaiah who walked stripped and barefoot for three years as a sign that the king of Assyria will lead away Egypt's captives and Cush's exiles, young and old, stripped and barefoot with bare buttocks—to Egypt's shame—and those who trusted in Cush and boasted in Egypt will be dismayed and put to shame.",
  "Isaiah 21": "An oracle concerning the Desert by the Sea: a dire vision has been shown—the traitor betrays and the destroyer destroys. Isaiah is staggered by what he hears, dismayed by what he sees, but a lookout cries 'Babylon has fallen!' and all the images of its gods lie shattered on the ground. An oracle concerning Edom and Arabia follows—disaster comes within a year.",
  "Isaiah 22": "An oracle concerning the Valley of Vision: what troubles you that you have gone up on the roofs? Jerusalem is full of commotion with slain not killed by sword or dead in battle, for the Lord has a day of tumult. Isaiah weeps bitterly over the destruction of his people, and though they call for weeping and mourning, instead there is joy and revelry, and God will depose Shebna the steward and call Eliakim His servant to replace him.",
  "Isaiah 23": "An oracle concerning Tyre: wail, you ships of Tarshish, for Tyre is destroyed without house or harbor, and the Lord planned it to bring down her pride. Tyre will be forgotten for seventy years, but at the end of seventy years she will sing like a prostitute and her earnings will be dedicated to the Lord, providing food and fine clothes for those who dwell before Him.",
  "Isaiah 24": "The Lord is going to lay waste the earth and devastate it, scattering its inhabitants—priest and people, master and servant alike. The earth dries up and withers under the curse from its inhabitants who have broken laws and violated the covenant, and though there are joyful shouts from the west and songs from the islands, Isaiah says 'I waste away, I waste away! Woe to me!' for terror and pit and snare await earth's people.",
  "Isaiah 25": "Isaiah praises the Lord who has done marvelous things, destroying the fortified city and refuge of ruthless nations, being a refuge for the poor and needy in distress. On this mountain the Lord will prepare a feast of rich food for all peoples, will swallow up death forever, wipe away tears from all faces, and remove His people's disgrace from all the earth, and they will say 'This is our God; we trusted in Him, and He saved us.'",
  "Isaiah 26": "In that day this song will be sung in Judah: We have a strong city; God makes salvation its walls and ramparts. Trust in the Lord forever, for He is the Rock eternal who humbles the proud and brings the lofty city down to dust. Your dead will live and their bodies will rise, for your dew is like morning dew, and the earth will give birth to her dead, so go my people, enter your rooms and close doors behind you until His wrath has passed.",
  "Isaiah 27": "In that day the Lord with His fierce and large sword will punish Leviathan the gliding serpent, killing the monster of the sea.

  "Isaiah 28": "Woe to the wreath of pride of Ephraim's drunkards and to the fading flower of its glorious beauty on the head of a fertile valley, for the Lord will hurl them down with His hand. Yet Jerusalem also mocks Isaiah's teaching as if for children with meaningless repetition, so God will speak to this people through foreign lips and strange tongues, and He lays a stone in Zion, a tested stone, a precious cornerstone for a sure foundation—the one who relies on it will never be stricken with panic.",
  "Isaiah 29": "Woe to Ariel (Jerusalem), the city where David settled—the Lord will besiege you, and you will be brought low speaking from the ground. Yet the ruthless will vanish, the mockers disappear, and those who err in spirit will gain understanding, for the Lord who redeemed Abraham says Jacob will no longer be ashamed when they see their children, the work of His hands, sanctifying His name and standing in awe of the God of Israel.",
  "Isaiah 30": "Woe to the obstinate children who carry out plans not from the Lord, going down to Egypt for help without consulting Him, but Pharaoh's protection will be your shame. Yet the Lord longs to be gracious and rises to show compassion—blessed are all who wait for Him—and though He gives you bread of adversity and water of affliction, your Teacher will no longer hide Himself, and whether you turn right or left, your ears will hear a voice saying 'This is the way; walk in it.'",
  "Isaiah 31": "Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help, relying on horses and trusting in chariots because they are many, but do not look to the Holy One of Israel or seek help from the Lord.

  "Isaiah 32": "A king will reign in righteousness and rulers will rule with justice, and each one will be like a shelter from the wind and a refuge from the storm.

  "Isaiah 33": "Woe to you destroyer who have not been destroyed, to you betrayer who have not been betrayed—when you stop destroying you will be destroyed. The Lord is exalted, filling Zion with justice and righteousness, and sinners in Zion are terrified asking 'Who can dwell with the consuming fire?' Those who walk righteously and speak what is right will dwell on heights with bread supplied and water assured, and they will see the King in His beauty and view a land that stretches afar.",
  "Isaiah 34": "The Lord is angry with all nations and their armies—He will totally destroy them and give them over to slaughter, for the Lord has a day of vengeance.

  "Isaiah 35": "The desert and parched land will be glad, the wilderness will rejoice and blossom like the crocus, for water will gush forth in the wilderness and streams in the desert. A highway called the Way of Holiness will be there—only the redeemed will walk on it—and those the Lord has rescued will return singing with everlasting joy upon their heads, overtaking them with gladness and joy while sorrow and sighing flee away.",
  "Isaiah 36": "In the fourteenth year of Hezekiah's reign, Sennacherib king of Assyria attacks Judah's fortified cities and captures them. The Assyrian field commander ridicules Hezekiah's trust in Egypt and the Lord, mocking that God told Assyria to march against Judah and destroy it, and he calls out in Hebrew for the people to hear, warning them not to let Hezekiah deceive them that the Lord will deliver them.",
  "Isaiah 37": "When King Hezekiah hears the Assyrian threats, he tears his clothes, puts on sackcloth, and goes into the temple of the Lord, sending word to Isaiah who prophesies that the Lord will make Sennacherib hear a rumor and return home where he will be cut down by the sword. Hezekiah prays earnestly before the Lord, and Isaiah sends word that the virgin daughter of Zion despises and mocks Sennacherib, and that night the angel of the Lord strikes down 185,000 in the Assyrian camp.",
  "Isaiah 38": "Hezekiah becomes ill and is at the point of death, and Isaiah tells him to put his house in order. Hezekiah turns his face to the wall and prays bitterly, and before Isaiah leaves the middle court, the word of the Lord comes telling him to return and say the Lord has heard his prayer and seen his tears, and will add fifteen years to his life and deliver Jerusalem from Assyria, and as a sign the shadow will go back ten steps.",
  "Isaiah 39": "Envoys from Babylon bring letters and a gift to Hezekiah who shows them all his treasures, storehouses, and armory—there is nothing in his palace or kingdom he does not show them. Isaiah comes and asks what the men saw, and prophesies that the time will come when everything in the palace and all that Hezekiah's ancestors have stored up will be carried off to Babylon, and some of his descendants will be taken away to become eunuchs in the palace of Babylon's king.",
  "Isaiah 40": "Comfort, comfort my people, says your God—speak tenderly to Jerusalem and proclaim that her hard service has been completed and her sin paid for. A voice cries 'Prepare the way for the Lord in the wilderness,' and though grass withers and flowers fall, the word of our God endures forever. Why do you say the Lord does not see your way? Do you not know? Have you not heard? He gives strength to the weary and increases the power of the weak, and those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength and soar on wings like eagles.",
  "Isaiah 41": "Be silent before Me, you islands—let us meet together at the place of judgment. Who has stirred up one from the east? I, the Lord, am the first and with the last—I am He. Do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen and help you and uphold you with My righteous right hand, for I am the Lord your God who takes hold of your right hand and says 'Do not fear; I will help you.'",
  "Isaiah 42": "Here is My servant whom I uphold, My chosen one in whom I delight—I will put My Spirit on Him and He will bring justice to the nations. He will not shout or cry out or raise His voice in the streets; a bruised reed He will not break and a smoldering wick He will not snuff out. Sing to the Lord a new song, His praise from the ends of the earth, but Israel is blind and deaf, robbed and plundered because of their sin.",
  "Isaiah 43": "Now this is what the Lord says—He who created you, O Jacob, He who formed you, O Israel: 'Do not fear, for I have redeemed you; I have summoned you by name; you are Mine.' When you pass through the waters, I will be with you, and when you walk through fire you will not be burned, for I am the Lord your God, the Holy One of Israel, your Savior. Forget the former things; see, I am doing a new thing—now it springs up; do you not perceive it?",
  "Isaiah 44": "Now listen, Jacob My servant, Israel whom I have chosen—I will pour water on the thirsty land and streams on the dry ground, I will pour out My Spirit on your offspring and My blessing on your descendants. But those who make idols are nothing, and the things they treasure are worthless—a carpenter measures and marks out wood, fashions it and makes it into the image of a man to dwell in a shrine. Yet I, the Lord, made all things, who says of Jerusalem 'It shall be inhabited' and of Cyrus 'He is My shepherd.'",
  "Isaiah 45": "This is what the Lord says to Cyrus, His anointed, whose right hand He takes hold of to subdue nations: I will go before you and level the mountains, breaking down gates of bronze and cutting through bars of iron, so you may know that I am the Lord who summons you by name. I form the light and create darkness, make peace and create calamity—I am the Lord who does all these things. Woe to those who quarrel with their Maker; does the clay say to the potter 'What are you making?'",
  "Isaiah 46": "Bel bows down and Nebo stoops low—their idols are borne by beasts of burden, but the Lord has made and will carry Israel, even to old age bearing and rescuing them. To whom will you compare God? Remember this and stand firm; recall the former things of old, for I am God and there is no other, declaring the end from the beginning, and My purpose will stand and I will do all that I please.",
  "Isaiah 47": "Go down, sit in the dust, Virgin Daughter Babylon, sit on the ground without a throne, Daughter of the Babylonians—no more will you be called tender or delicate. Your nakedness will be exposed and your shame uncovered; I will take vengeance and will spare no one. You felt secure in your wickedness saying 'No one sees me,' but disaster will come upon you suddenly, and your many sorceries and potent spells cannot save you.",
  "Isaiah 48": "Listen to this, house of Jacob who are called by the name of Israel—I foretold the former things long ago then suddenly acted and they came to pass, for I knew you were stubborn with a neck of iron and forehead of bronze. For My own sake, for My own sake I do this, and I will not yield My glory to another. Leave Babylon, flee from the Babylonians with shouts of joy, proclaiming to the ends of the earth 'The Lord has redeemed His servant Jacob.'",
  "Isaiah 49": "Listen to Me, you islands; the Lord called Me from the womb, from My mother's body He has spoken My name. Though Israel is not gathered, I will be glorious in the eyes of the Lord, for He says 'I will also make you a light for the Gentiles, that My salvation may reach to the ends of the earth.' Can a mother forget the baby at her breast? Though she may forget, I will not forget you—see, I have engraved you on the palms of My hands.",
  "Isaiah 50": "Where is your mother's certificate of divorce with which I sent her away? You were sold because of your sins, and your mother was sent away because of your transgressions. The Sovereign Lord has given Me a well-instructed tongue to sustain the weary with a word, and He wakens My ear to listen like one being instructed. I offered My back to those who beat Me, My cheeks to those who pulled out My beard, and did not hide My face from mocking and spitting, but the Lord helps Me, so I set My face like flint.",
  "Isaiah 51": "Listen to Me, you who pursue righteousness and who seek the Lord: Look to the rock from which you were cut and to Abraham your father and Sarah who gave you birth. Awake, awake, arm of the Lord! The ransomed of the Lord will return and enter Zion with singing, everlasting joy upon their heads. I am He who comforts you; who are you that you fear mere mortals who are but grass?",
  "Isaiah 52": "Awake, awake, Zion, clothe yourself with strength! Shake off your dust, rise up and sit enthroned, Jerusalem, for you were sold for nothing and without money you will be redeemed. How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of those who bring good news, who proclaim peace and salvation, saying to Zion 'Your God reigns!' My servant will act wisely and be raised and lifted up and highly exalted, yet His appearance was so disfigured beyond that of any human being.",
  "Isaiah 53": "Who has believed our message? He grew up like a tender shoot and like a root out of dry ground—He had no beauty that we should desire Him, despised and rejected, a man of suffering familiar with pain. But He was pierced for our transgressions, crushed for our iniquities, the punishment that brought us peace was on Him, and by His wounds we are healed. The Lord laid on Him the iniquity of us all, yet after suffering He will see the light of life and be satisfied, justifying many as He bears their iniquities.",
  "Isaiah 54": "Sing, barren woman, you who never bore a child, for more are the children of the desolate woman than of her who has a husband. Enlarge the place of your tent and do not hold back, for you will spread out to the right and to the left. Though the mountains be shaken and hills be removed, yet My unfailing love for you will not be shaken, says the Lord who has compassion on you, and all your children will be taught by the Lord.",
  "Isaiah 55": "Come, all you who are thirsty, come to the waters, and you who have no money, come buy and eat without money and without cost. Why spend money on what is not bread? Listen, listen to Me, and eat what is good, and you will delight in the richest of fare. Seek the Lord while He may be found; let the wicked forsake their ways and return to the Lord who will freely pardon, for His thoughts are not our thoughts and His ways higher than our ways, and His word will not return empty but will accomplish what He desires.",
  "Isaiah 56": "Maintain justice and do what is right, for My salvation is close at hand. Blessed is the one who does this, keeping the Sabbath and keeping their hands from doing evil. Let no foreigner who is bound to the Lord say 'The Lord will surely exclude me,' and let no eunuch complain, for their house will be called a house of prayer for all nations. But Israel's watchmen are blind, they all lack knowledge, they are shepherds who lack understanding, each pursues their own gain.",
  "Isaiah 57": "The righteous perish and no one takes it to heart—they are taken away to be spared from evil, entering into peace. But you who practice sorcery and adultery, you offspring of liars and prostitutes, to whom are you mocking? You have made your bed on a high and lofty hill and went up there to offer sacrifices. For this is what the high and exalted One says—I live in a high and holy place, but also with the one who is contrite and lowly in spirit, to revive the spirit of the lowly and the heart of the contrite.",
  "Isaiah 58": "Shout it aloud, declare to My people their rebellion—they seek Me daily and delight to know My ways, yet on the day of fasting they do as they please and exploit workers. Is this the kind of fast I have chosen? Is not this the kind I have chosen: to loose the chains of injustice, share your food with the hungry, provide shelter for the poor wanderer, and clothe the naked? Then your light will break forth like the dawn and your healing will quickly appear, and you will call and the Lord will answer.",
  "Isaiah 59": "Surely the arm of the Lord is not too short to save, nor His ear too dull to hear, but your iniquities have separated you from your God and your sins have hidden His face. So justice is far from us and righteousness does not reach us; we look for light but all is darkness. The Lord looked and was displeased that there was no justice, so His own arm achieved salvation and His own righteousness sustained Him, and the Redeemer will come to Zion.",
  "Isaiah 60": "Arise, shine, for your light has come, and the glory of the Lord rises upon you. Nations will come to your light and kings to the brightness of your dawn, and all assemble and come to you—your sons from afar and daughters carried on the hip. Then you will look and be radiant, your heart will throb and swell with joy, for the wealth on the seas will be brought to you, and you will know that I, the Lord, am your Savior.",
  "Isaiah 61": "The Spirit of the Sovereign Lord is on Me, because the Lord has anointed Me to proclaim good news to the poor, to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim freedom for the captives and release from darkness for prisoners, to comfort all who mourn and provide for those who grieve in Zion—bestowing on them a crown of beauty instead of ashes, the oil of joy instead of mourning, and a garment of praise instead of despair. Instead of shame you will receive a double portion, and everlasting joy will be yours.",
  "Isaiah 62": "For Zion's sake I will not keep silent until her vindication shines out like the dawn and her salvation like a blazing torch. You will be called by a new name that the mouth of the Lord will bestow—no longer will you be called Deserted or Desolate, but you will be called Hephzibah (My delight is in her) and your land Beulah (Married), for the Lord will take delight in you and your land will be married. See, your Savior comes!",
  "Isaiah 63": "Who is this coming from Edom with garments stained crimson from Bozrah? It is I, the Lord, proclaiming victory, mighty to save, who has trodden the winepress alone, and the blood of My enemies has stained all My clothing. Look down from heaven and see—where are Your zeal and Your mighty acts? You are our Father; we are the clay, You are the potter, we are all the work of Your hand.",
  "Isaiah 64": "Oh, that You would rend the heavens and come down, that the mountains would tremble before You! When You did awesome things we did not expect, You came down and the mountains trembled. Since ancient times no one has heard, no ear has perceived, no eye has seen any God besides You who acts on behalf of those who wait for Him. Yet You come to the help of those who gladly do right, who remember Your ways.",
  "Isaiah 65": "I revealed Myself to those who did not ask for Me and was found by those who did not seek Me, but all day long I have held out My hands to a disobedient and obstinate people. See, I will create new heavens and a new earth, and the former things will not be remembered. I will create Jerusalem to be a delight and her people a joy—the sound of weeping and crying will be heard in her no more, for before they call I will answer.",
  "Isaiah 66": "Heaven is My throne and the earth is My footstool—where is the house you will build for Me? This is the one I esteem: those who are humble and contrite in spirit and tremble at My word. As a mother comforts her child, so will I comfort you, and you will be comforted over Jerusalem. For the Lord will come with fire to bring down His rebuke with flames, yet those who consecrate themselves will come to an end together. I will set a sign among them and send survivors to the nations, and they will proclaim My glory among the nations, and all mankind will come and bow down before Me.",
  "Jeremiah 1": "The word of the Lord comes to Jeremiah son of Hilkiah during the reign of Josiah, and God tells him that before he was formed in the womb, He knew him and set him apart as a prophet to the nations. Jeremiah protests that he is too young and doesn't know how to speak, but God touches his mouth saying 'I have put my words in your mouth,' and appoints him to uproot and tear down, to destroy and overthrow, to build and to plant.",
  "Jeremiah 2": "God declares that Israel has forsaken Him, the spring of living water, and has dug their own broken cisterns that cannot hold water. He recalls how He brought them out of Egypt and through the wilderness, but they defiled His land and made it detestable, and even the priests did not ask 'Where is the Lord?' God marvels that His people have exchanged their glorious God for worthless idols.",
  "Jeremiah 3": "God calls Israel a faithless wife who has prostituted herself with many lovers under every spreading tree, yet He invites her to return. Though Judah saw unfaithful Israel sent away and divorced, Judah did not fear but also played the harlot, not returning to God with her whole heart but only in pretense, and God declares faithless Israel more righteous than treacherous Judah.",
  "Jeremiah 4": "If Israel will return to the Lord and remove their detestable idols, they will not be uprooted, but Jeremiah sees disaster coming from the north like a hot wind. He sees the earth formless and empty, the heavens with no light, mountains quaking, and no people—desolation because of God's fierce anger, yet He will not destroy completely, and Jeremiah's heart pounds as he hears the trumpet and battle cry.",
  "Jeremiah 5": "God commands to go through Jerusalem's streets looking for one person who deals honestly and seeks truth, but even the leaders have broken the yoke and torn off the bonds. Like a cage full of birds, their houses are full of deceit and they have grown fat and sleek, yet they do not plead the case of the fatherless or defend the just cause of the poor, so God will bring a distant nation against them whose quiver is like an open grave.",
  "Jeremiah 6": "Flee from Jerusalem for disaster looms from the north and great destruction! The city is full of oppression, violence, and destruction; from the least to the greatest all are greedy for gain, and from prophet to priest all practice deceit, saying 'Peace, peace' when there is no peace. They do not know how to blush, so God will bring disaster upon this people, the fruit of their schemes, for they have not listened to His words or kept His law.",
  "Jeremiah 7": "Jeremiah stands at the temple gate and proclaims that they must not trust in deceptive words saying 'This is the temple of the Lord,' for if they truly change their ways and do not oppress the foreigner, fatherless, or widow, then God will let them live in this place. But they steal, murder, commit adultery, burn incense to Baal, yet come and stand before Him in this house and say 'We are safe'—has this house become a den of robbers?",
  "Jeremiah 8": "At that time the bones of Judah's kings, officials, priests, and prophets will be removed from their graves and exposed, for death will be preferable to life for all who remain. The people are skilled in doing evil but know not how to do good, and from prophet to priest everyone deals falsely, yet they say 'Peace, peace' when there is no peace, and Jeremiah weeps for his people's wounds.",
  "Jeremiah 9": "Jeremiah wishes his head were a spring of water and his eyes a fountain of tears to weep day and night for the slain of his people. They go from one sin to another and do not acknowledge God, friend deceives friend, and no one speaks the truth, so God will refine and test them, for what else can He do because of the sin of His people? Let the wise not boast of their wisdom or the strong of their strength or the rich of their riches, but let those who boast boast that they understand and know the Lord.",
  "Jeremiah 10": "Do not learn the ways of the nations or be terrified by signs in the heavens, for the practices of the peoples are worthless—idols are like scarecrows in a cucumber field that cannot speak or walk. But the Lord is the true God, the living God, the eternal King, and when He is angry the earth trembles, yet by His power He made the earth and established the world by His wisdom, and everyone is senseless and without knowledge.",
  "Jeremiah 11": "God tells Jeremiah to proclaim the terms of the covenant He made with their ancestors when He brought them out of Egypt, commanding them to obey Him. But they did not listen and followed the stubbornness of their evil hearts, so God will bring on them all the curses of the covenant, and though they cry out to Him in their time of trouble, He will not listen, and Jeremiah is told not to pray for this people or plead with God on their behalf.",
  "Jeremiah 12": "Jeremiah questions why the wicked prosper and the faithless live at ease, for they speak well of God but their hearts are far from Him. God responds that if Jeremiah has raced with men on foot and they have worn him out, how can he compete with horses? He declares that He has forsaken His house and abandoned His inheritance, giving the one He loves into the hands of her enemies, yet He will have compassion and bring each one back to their own inheritance.",
  "Jeremiah 13": "God tells Jeremiah to buy a linen belt, wear it, then hide it in a rock crevice where it becomes ruined—illustrating how God will ruin the pride of Judah and Jerusalem who refuse to listen. He warns them to give glory to God before He brings darkness, for can Ethiopians change their skin or leopards their spots? Neither can those who are accustomed to doing evil do good, so He will scatter them like chaff driven by the desert wind.",
  "Jeremiah 14": "Drought comes upon Judah—nobles send their servants for water but find none, farmers are dismayed, and even the doe abandons her newborn. Though Jeremiah pleads for God to act for His name's sake and acknowledges their wickedness, God tells him not to pray for their well-being, for though Moses and Samuel stood before Him, He would not look on this people with favor, and sword, famine, pestilence, and captivity await them.",
  "Jeremiah 15": "God declares that those destined for death will go to death, those for the sword to the sword, and He will make Judah abhorrent to all kingdoms because of what Manasseh did in Jerusalem. Jeremiah laments his birth and asks why his pain is unending and his wound incurable, but God promises that if he repents and speaks worthy words, He will be Jeremiah's spokesman, and though they fight against him, they will not overcome him.",
  "Jeremiah 16": "God tells Jeremiah not to marry or have children in this place, for terrible death awaits those born here, and not to enter a house of mourning or feasting, for He has withdrawn His blessing, love, and pity. Yet He promises that days are coming when people will no longer say 'As surely as the Lord lives who brought Israel up out of Egypt' but will speak of God bringing them back from captivity, and He will teach them His power and might.",
  "Jeremiah 17": "Judah's sin is engraved with an iron tool on their hearts and on the horns of their altars, and those who turn away from the Lord will be written in the dust because they have forsaken the Lord, the spring of living water. Blessed is the one who trusts in the Lord, whose confidence is in Him—they will be like a tree planted by water that does not fear when heat comes, but cursed is the one who trusts in man and turns away from the Lord.",
  "Jeremiah 18": "God sends Jeremiah to the potter's house where he watches the potter shape clay, and when a pot is marred, the potter forms it into another pot. God declares that like clay in the potter's hand, so are nations in His hand—if they repent of evil He relents from disaster, and if they do evil He reconsiders the good He intended, but the people respond 'It's no use, we will continue with our own plans.'",
  "Jeremiah 19": "God tells Jeremiah to buy a clay jar, take some elders and priests to the Valley of Ben Hinnom, and proclaim that He will bring such disaster on Jerusalem that the ears of everyone who hears will tingle, for they have filled this place with innocent blood. Jeremiah then breaks the jar as the men watch, declaring God will smash this nation and city as one smashes a potter's vessel that cannot be repaired.",
  "Jeremiah 20": "When Pashhur the priest hears Jeremiah prophesying, he has him beaten and put in stocks at the temple gate. The next day Jeremiah tells him that God will make him a terror to himself and all his friends, and Babylon will carry Judah away captive. Jeremiah then curses the day he was born, wishing he had died in the womb rather than see trouble and sorrow and end his days in shame.",
  "Jeremiah 21": "When King Zedekiah sends messengers asking Jeremiah to inquire of the Lord because Nebuchadnezzar is attacking, God responds that He will fight against them with an outstretched hand and mighty arm in fierce anger. He offers the people a choice—the way of life or the way of death—for those who stay in the city will die by sword, famine, or plague, but those who go out and surrender to the Babylonians will live.",
  "Jeremiah 22": "Go down to the palace of the king of Judah and declare that if he administers justice, he will have successors on David's throne, but if not, this palace will become a ruin. Concerning Jehoiakim: He will have the burial of a donkey, dragged away and thrown outside Jerusalem's gates, and concerning Jehoiachin (Coniah): Even if he were a signet ring on God's right hand, God would pull him off and give him to Babylon, and none of his descendants will sit on David's throne.",
  "Jeremiah 23": "Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of God's pasture! God will gather the remnant of His flock and place shepherds over them who will care for them, and He will raise up for David a righteous Branch who will reign wisely and do what is just and right. The prophets are ungodly—both prophet and priest are profane, and the prophets of Jerusalem commit adultery and live a lie, prophesying out of their own minds and saying 'I had a dream!' but God did not send them.",
  "Jeremiah 24": "After Nebuchadnezzar carries Jehoiachin into exile, God shows Jeremiah two baskets of figs—one with very good figs and one with very bad figs too rotten to eat. The good figs represent the exiles God sent to Babylon whom He will watch over for their good and bring back, giving them a heart to know Him, but the bad figs represent Zedekiah and those who remain in Jerusalem whom God will make abhorrent to all kingdoms.",
  "Jeremiah 25": "In the fourth year of Jehoiakim, Jeremiah declares that for twenty-three years God has spoken but the people have not listened, so He will bring Nebuchadnezzar against Judah and they will serve the king of Babylon for seventy years. Then God will punish Babylon, and He gives Jeremiah a cup filled with the wine of His wrath to make all the nations drink, causing them to stagger and go mad because of the sword He will send among them.",
  "Jeremiah 26": "Early in Jehoiakim's reign, God tells Jeremiah to stand in the temple courtyard and proclaim that unless they listen and turn from their evil ways, He will make this temple like Shiloh. The priests and prophets seize Jeremiah saying he must die for prophesying against the temple and city, but the officials and people defend him, remembering how Micah prophesied similarly in Hezekiah's time and was not put to death.",
  "Jeremiah 27": "Early in Zedekiah's reign, God tells Jeremiah to make a yoke with straps and put it on his neck, then send messages to surrounding kings that God has given all these lands to Nebuchadnezzar. Do not listen to prophets who say 'You will not serve the king of Babylon,' for they are prophesying lies—serve him and live, for why should your city become a ruin?",
  "Jeremiah 28": "The prophet Hananiah proclaims in the temple that God will break the yoke of Babylon and within two years bring back the articles from the temple and all the exiles. Jeremiah responds 'Amen! May the Lord do so!' but warns that prophets who prophesy peace are recognized as truly sent only when their predictions come true, and when Hananiah breaks the yoke off Jeremiah's neck, Jeremiah returns saying God will replace the wooden yoke with an iron one, and Hananiah will die this year for preaching rebellion.",
  "Jeremiah 29": "Jeremiah sends a letter to the exiles in Babylon saying to build houses, plant gardens, and multiply there, for after seventy years God will bring them back. 'For I know the plans I have for you,' declares the Lord, 'plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.' But concerning the false prophets Ahab and Zedekiah in Babylon—the king will roast them in the fire for their vileness and adultery.",
  "Jeremiah 30": "God tells Jeremiah to write in a book all the words He has spoken, for days are coming when He will bring His people back from captivity and restore them to the land. Though Jacob will be saved from a time of trouble unequaled from ancient times, God will not completely destroy them but will discipline them with justice, breaking the yoke from their neck and tearing off their bonds, and David their king will rule over them.",
  "Jeremiah 31": "At that time God will be the God of all Israel's families and they will be His people, for the Lord has appeared from afar saying 'I have loved you with an everlasting love; I have drawn you with unfailing kindness.' He will bring them from the land of the north and gather them, and Rachel weeping for her children will be comforted, for they will return. God will make a new covenant with Israel, writing His law on their hearts, and all will know Him from the least to the greatest.",
  "Jeremiah 32": "While Jeremiah is confined in the courtyard during Jerusalem's siege, God tells him to buy his cousin's field in Anathoth, for houses, fields, and vineyards will again be bought in this land. After completing the purchase, Jeremiah prays acknowledging God's power in creation and redemption, and God responds that He will gather His people from all lands where He has banished them and bring them back, giving them singleness of heart to fear Him, and they will be His people.",
  "Jeremiah 33": "While Jeremiah is still confined, God speaks promising to bring health and healing to the city, restoring Judah and Israel and cleansing them from all their sins. Joy and gladness will be heard again—the voices of bride and bridegroom and those bringing thank offerings to the temple, for God will restore the fortunes of the land, and a righteous Branch will spring from David's line who will do what is just and right.",
  "Jeremiah 34": "While Nebuchadnezzar is fighting against Jerusalem, God tells Jeremiah to warn Zedekiah that the city will be given to Babylon and burned, though he will die peacefully. Later, after the people free their Hebrew slaves in covenant but then take them back, God condemns them for proclaiming freedom for their slaves then taking them back, so He proclaims 'freedom' for them—freedom to fall by sword, plague, and famine.",
  "Jeremiah 35": "God sends Jeremiah to the Rekabite family who refuse to drink wine because their ancestor Jehonadab commanded them not to, and they have obeyed for generations, never building houses or planting vineyards. God uses them as an example—if the Rekabites obeyed their ancestor, why hasn't Judah obeyed Him? Because of Judah's disobedience, disaster will come, but the Rekabites will always have descendants to serve Him.",
  "Jeremiah 36": "In the fourth year of Jehoiakim, God tells Jeremiah to write on a scroll all the words spoken against Israel, Judah, and the nations. Baruch writes as Jeremiah dictates, then reads the scroll in the temple, and when officials hear it they report to the king who cuts the scroll apart and burns it in the fire, but God tells Jeremiah to take another scroll and write all the words again, adding more besides.",
  "Jeremiah 37": "King Zedekiah sends messengers to Jeremiah asking him to pray, and Jeremiah prophesies that the Babylonian army will return and burn Jerusalem—even if you defeated the entire Babylonian army, only wounded men would remain in their tents, yet they would rise up and burn the city. When Jeremiah tries to leave the city, he is arrested as a deserter, beaten, and imprisoned in a dungeon where he remains many days until Zedekiah secretly asks if there is any word from the Lord.",
  "Jeremiah 38": "Officials hear Jeremiah telling soldiers to surrender to the Babylonians to save their lives, so they convince the king to put him to death, lowering him with ropes into a cistern with mud but no water. Ebed-Melek the Cushite speaks to the king who allows him to lift Jeremiah out with old rags and worn-out clothes under his arms, and when Zedekiah questions Jeremiah privately, he urges him to surrender to Babylon's officers to save his life and the city.",
  "Jeremiah 39": "In Zedekiah's ninth year, Nebuchadnezzar besieges Jerusalem, and in the eleventh year the city wall is broken through. Zedekiah flees but is captured, his sons are killed before his eyes, his eyes are put out, and he is taken to Babylon in bronze shackles. The Babylonians burn the royal palace and houses and tear down Jerusalem's walls, but Nebuchadnezzar orders Jeremiah to be taken care of and freed.",
  "Jeremiah 40": "After being freed at Ramah, Jeremiah chooses to stay with Gedaliah whom the king of Babylon appointed as governor over the towns of Judah. Jews scattered in various countries hear that Babylon has left a remnant and return to Gedaliah, but Johanan warns Gedaliah that Ishmael is coming to kill him, though Gedaliah refuses to believe it.",
  "Jeremiah 41": "Ishmael son of Nethaniah comes with ten men and kills Gedaliah along with the Judeans and Babylonian soldiers with him. The next day eighty men arrive to bring offerings to the temple, and Ishmael kills them all except ten who bribe him with hidden stores of wheat and barley, then he takes captives including the king's daughters, but Johanan pursues and rescues them, and Ishmael escapes to the Ammonites.",
  "Jeremiah 42": "The army officers and all the people ask Jeremiah to pray and inquire of the Lord whether they should stay in Judah or flee to Egypt. After ten days God answers through Jeremiah: If you stay in this land, I will build you up and plant you, but if you go to Egypt you will die by sword, famine, and plague, for My anger will be poured out on you and you will never see this place again.",
  "Jeremiah 43": "Azariah, Johanan, and arrogant men accuse Jeremiah of lying and claim Baruch is inciting him against them, so they refuse to obey God's command to stay in Judah and take everyone including Jeremiah and Baruch to Egypt. God tells Jeremiah to take large stones and bury them in the pavement at Pharaoh's palace in Tahpanhes, prophesying that Nebuchadnezzar will set his throne over these stones and strike down Egypt.",
  "Jeremiah 44": "Jeremiah speaks to all the Jews living in Egypt, reminding them of Jerusalem's destruction because of their wickedness and idol worship, and warns that if they persist in burning incense to other gods in Egypt, they will be consumed by sword and famine. The people refuse to listen, saying they will continue burning incense to the Queen of Heaven as they and their ancestors did, and Jeremiah declares God's name will no longer be invoked in Egypt and only a few fugitives will return to Judah.",
  "Jeremiah 45": "In the fourth year of Jehoiakim, Jeremiah speaks to Baruch who laments 'Woe to me! The Lord has added sorrow to my pain; I am worn out with groaning and find no rest.' God tells Baruch that what He has built He will tear down, and what He has planted He will uproot, yet Baruch should not seek great things for himself but be content that God will let him escape with his life wherever he goes.",
  "Jeremiah 46": "Concerning Egypt: God declares that Egypt's army will stumble and fall at the Euphrates River, for this is the day of the Lord when He will take vengeance on His foes. Yet Israel should not be afraid, for God will save them from distant lands, bring them back from captivity, and discipline them with justice but not completely destroy them, though He will completely destroy all the nations where He scatters them.",
  "Jeremiah 47": "This is the word of the Lord concerning the Philistines before Pharaoh attacks Gaza: Waters are rising in the north and becoming an overflowing torrent that will overflow the land and everything in it. Gaza will shave her head in mourning and Ashkelon will be silenced, for the Lord has a sword against the Philistines and the remnant from the coasts.",
  "Jeremiah 48": "Concerning Moab: Woe to Nebo for it will be ruined, and Kiriathaim will be disgraced and captured. Moab has been at rest from youth like wine left on its dregs, never poured from one jar to another or gone into exile, but days are coming when God will send those who will pour her out. Moab will be ashamed of Chemosh as Israel was ashamed of Bethel, and the pride of Moab will be destroyed.",
  "Jeremiah 49": "Concerning Ammon: Does Israel have no sons or heirs? Why then has Molek taken possession of Gad? Concerning Edom: If grape pickers came they would leave gleanings, if thieves at night they would steal only what they wanted, but God has stripped Esau bare and his descendants will be destroyed. Concerning Damascus, Kedar, Hazor, and Elam—all will face God's judgment and destruction.",
  "Jeremiah 50": "Concerning Babylon: Declare among the nations that Babylon will be captured and Bel put to shame, for a nation from the north will attack her. Israel and Judah will come weeping to seek the Lord their God, joining themselves in an everlasting covenant, for their shepherds led them astray. Come out of Babylon and be like goats leading the flock, for God will stir up and bring against Babylon an alliance of great nations from the north.",
  "Jeremiah 51": "God will raise up a destroyer against Babylon and those who live in Leb Kamai—sharpen the arrows and fill the quivers! Though Babylon reached the heavens and fortified her lofty stronghold, destroyers will come, for this is the vengeance of the Lord. Flee from Babylon, run for your lives, for God will repay her for her deeds, and though heaven and earth shout for joy over Babylon's fall, her wounded will groan.",
  "Jeremiah 52": "This final chapter records the fall of Jerusalem—Zedekiah rebels against Babylon in his ninth year, the city is besieged for two years, famine becomes severe, the city wall is broken through, and Zedekiah is captured. The Babylonians burn the temple, royal palace, and all important buildings, break down the walls, and carry the people into exile. Yet in the thirty-seventh year of exile, Jehoiachin king of Judah is released from prison and given a seat of honor above other kings.",
  "Lamentations 1": "How deserted lies the city once full of people, now like a widow! She who was great among nations is now a slave, weeping bitterly at night with tears on her cheeks. All her friends have betrayed her, her gates are desolate, her priests groan, her young women grieve, and her enemies have become her masters because of her many sins, for the Lord has brought her grief.",
  "Lamentations 2": "How the Lord has covered Daughter Zion with the cloud of His anger! He has thrown down Israel's splendor from heaven, cut off every horn of Israel in His fierce anger, and withdrawn His right hand. He has bent His bow like an enemy and poured out His wrath like fire, destroying the temple He once called His dwelling place, and both prophet and priest have been killed in the sanctuary of the Lord.",
  "Lamentations 3": "The writer is the man who has seen affliction by the rod of God's wrath—He has driven him into darkness without light, besieged him, and made his skin and flesh grow old. Yet there is hope because of the Lord's great love and compassion that never fail, for His compassions are new every morning, and though He brings grief, He will show compassion according to His unfailing love, and it is good to wait quietly for the Lord's salvation.",
  "Lamentations 4": "How the gold has lost its luster and the fine gold become dull! The precious children of Zion once worth their weight in gold are now considered as clay pots. Even jackals offer their breasts to nurse their young, but the daughter of my people has become heartless like ostriches in the desert, and young children beg for bread but no one gives it to them, for the punishment of my people is greater than that of Sodom.",
  "Lamentations 5": "Remember, Lord, what has happened to us—our inheritance has been turned over to foreigners, we have become fatherless orphans and our mothers are widows. We must buy the water we drink and the wood we burn, and we are pursued to the point of exhaustion with no rest. Mount Zion lies desolate with jackals prowling over it, yet You, Lord, reign forever and Your throne endures through all generations—restore us to Yourself, O Lord, that we may return.",
  "Ezekiel 1": "In the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, while Ezekiel is among the exiles by the Kebar River in Babylon, the heavens are opened and he sees visions of God. He sees an immense cloud with flashing lightning surrounded by brilliant light, and in the fire are four living creatures with human form but four faces and four wings each, beside them wheels within wheels, and above them an expanse like crystal with a throne of lapis lazuli, and high above is a figure like that of a man radiating brilliant light—the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord.",
  "Ezekiel 2": "The voice says 'Son of man, stand up on your feet and I will speak to you,' and the Spirit enters Ezekiel and sets him on his feet. God sends him to the rebellious Israelites who are obstinate and stubborn, telling him not to be afraid of them or their words though briers and thorns are all around and he lives among scorpions, for they are a rebellious people, yet whether they listen or fail to listen, they will know a prophet has been among them.",
  "Ezekiel 3": "God gives Ezekiel a scroll to eat that tastes as sweet as honey in his mouth, then sends him to the exiles to speak His words whether they listen or fail to listen. God makes Ezekiel's forehead like the hardest stone, harder than flint, and appoints him as a watchman for Israel—if he warns the wicked and they don't turn from their wickedness, they will die for their sin, but if he fails to warn them, God will hold him accountable for their blood.",
  "Ezekiel 4": "God commands Ezekiel to take a clay tablet, draw Jerusalem on it, and lay siege against it with ramps and battering rams as a sign to Israel. He must lie on his left side for 390 days bearing Israel's sin, then on his right side for 40 days bearing Judah's sin, and eat rationed food cooked over cow dung to symbolize the defiled food Israel will eat in the nations where God scatters them.",
  "Ezekiel 5": "God tells Ezekiel to shave his head and beard, divide the hair into thirds—burning one third in the city, striking one third with the sword around the city, and scattering one third to the wind while pursuing them with drawn sword. This symbolizes what God will do to Jerusalem because they have rejected His laws and been more wicked than the nations around them, so He will inflict punishment in anger and wrath.",
  "Ezekiel 6": "The word of the Lord comes against the mountains of Israel, declaring He will destroy their high places and idols, slaughtering the people before their idols and scattering their bones around the altars. Yet He will spare some who will be scattered among the nations, and they will remember the Lord and loathe themselves for the evil they have done, knowing that He is the Lord.",
  "Ezekiel 7": "The end has come upon the four corners of the land—God's anger is unleashed, He will judge according to their conduct and repay for all their detestable practices. Disaster after disaster is coming, the day has come with doom near, panic instead of joy on the mountains, and though they throw their silver into the streets and gold becomes unclean, their wealth cannot save them on the day of the Lord's wrath.",
  "Ezekiel 8": "In the sixth year, while Ezekiel sits in his house with the elders of Judah, the hand of the Sovereign Lord comes on him and a figure like a man takes him in visions to Jerusalem. There he sees detestable things—an idol that provokes jealousy at the entrance, elders burning incense to idols in dark rooms, women mourning for Tammuz, and men with their backs to the temple worshiping the sun.",
  "Ezekiel 9": "God calls for the guards of the city who come with deadly weapons, and a man clothed in linen with a writing kit is told to go through Jerusalem and put a mark on the foreheads of those who grieve and lament over the detestable things. The others are commanded to follow and kill without mercy—old men, young men, young women, mothers and children—but not to touch anyone with the mark, and they begin at the sanctuary.",
  "Ezekiel 10": "God tells the man clothed in linen to take burning coals from among the cherubim and scatter them over the city. Ezekiel sees the glory of the Lord rise from the cherubim and move to the threshold of the temple, and the cherubim lift their wings and rise with the wheels beside them, and the glory of the Lord departs from over the threshold of the temple and stops above the cherubim.",
  "Ezekiel 11": "The Spirit lifts Ezekiel up and brings him to the gate of the temple where he sees twenty-five men including leaders giving wicked counsel, saying 'Haven't our houses been recently rebuilt? This city is a pot, and we are the meat in it.' God says this pot is not a refuge—He will drag them out and execute judgment at Israel's borders, and He will give the exiles an undivided heart and a new spirit.",
  "Ezekiel 12": "God tells Ezekiel to pack belongings for exile and dig through the wall in the evening while the people watch, for this is a sign concerning the prince in Jerusalem and all Israel. The people say 'The days go by and every vision comes to nothing,' but God replies the days are near when every vision will be fulfilled, and there will no longer be false visions or flattering divinations among Israel.",
  "Ezekiel 13": "Woe to the foolish prophets who follow their own spirit and have seen nothing! They prophesy peace when there is no peace, and when people build a flimsy wall, they cover it with whitewash, but God will tear down the wall and expose its foundation. He is also against women who practice magic charms on their wrists and veils on their heads to ensnare people, for they profane Him for handfuls of barley and scraps of bread.",
  "Ezekiel 14": "When some elders come to inquire of the Lord, God tells Ezekiel they have set up idols in their hearts, so He will answer them according to their idolatry. Even if Noah, Daniel, and Job were in Jerusalem, they could save only themselves by their righteousness, not their sons or daughters, yet God will send survivors out of Jerusalem to the exiles who will see their conduct and be consoled about the disaster He has brought.",
  "Ezekiel 15": "God asks how the wood of a vine is better than any other wood—is wood taken from it to make anything useful? If it was not useful before being burned, how much less after fire consumes it! So it is with the people of Jerusalem—God has given them over to the fire, and though they come out of one fire, another will consume them, for they have been unfaithful.",
  "Ezekiel 16": "God reminds Jerusalem that she was abandoned at birth like an unwanted child, but He passed by and made her grow, later entering into a covenant and dressing her in fine garments and jewelry. Yet she trusted in her beauty and used her fame to become a prostitute, even sacrificing her children to idols, so she is worse than Sodom and Samaria, yet God will remember His covenant and establish an everlasting covenant with her.",
  "Ezekiel 17": "God tells Ezekiel a riddle about a great eagle that took the top of a cedar to a city of traders, then planted a seed that became a spreading vine. But the vine turned toward another eagle, so God declares the first eagle (Babylon) will uproot it and it will wither, for Zedekiah broke his treaty and will be taken to Babylon and die there, yet God will take a shoot from the top of the cedar and plant it on a high mountain where it will become a splendid cedar.",
  "Ezekiel 18": "The people quote a proverb: 'The parents eat sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge,' but God declares this proverb will no longer be quoted, for every soul belongs to Him—the one who sins will die. The righteous person will live, the wicked will die, and if the wicked turn from their ways they will live, for God takes no pleasure in the death of anyone but wants them to turn and live.",
  "Ezekiel 19": "Take up a lament for the princes of Israel: Your mother was like a lioness who raised her cubs, and one became a strong lion that learned to tear prey and devour people, but nations trapped him and led him with hooks to Egypt. She raised another cub who also became a strong lion, but he was captured and brought to Babylon in a cage where his roar is heard no more on the mountains of Israel.",
  "Ezekiel 20": "In the seventh year, elders come to inquire of the Lord, and God tells the history of Israel's rebellion—how He swore to bring them out of Egypt to a land flowing with milk and honey, yet they rebelled and did not forsake Egyptian idols. Again in the wilderness they rebelled, profaning His Sabbaths, yet for His name's sake He did not destroy them but scattered them among the nations, and still they will be judged.",
  "Ezekiel 21": "The word of the Lord comes against Jerusalem—God will draw His sword from its sheath and cut off both the righteous and the wicked. The sword is sharpened and polished for slaughter, and it will strike Ammon as well, for God has drawn His sword and it will not return to its sheath until His wrath is satisfied and the city becomes a desolate waste.",
  "Ezekiel 22": "God condemns Jerusalem as the city of bloodshed full of idols that defile herself, bringing her days to a close and the end of her years. Her princes are like wolves tearing prey to shed blood, her prophets whitewash their deeds, her priests violate the law, and her people practice extortion and oppress the poor, so God will pour out His wrath and consume them with His fiery anger.",
  "Ezekiel 23": "There were two sisters, Oholah (Samaria) and Oholibah (Jerusalem), who became prostitutes in Egypt from their youth. Oholah lusted after Assyria and was given to her lovers who stripped her naked and killed her, yet her sister Oholibah became even more depraved, lusting after Babylonians, so God will bring her lovers against her in wrath and deal with her in anger and jealous fury.",
  "Ezekiel 24": "On the very day Nebuchadnezzar lays siege to Jerusalem, God tells Ezekiel to put a pot on the fire, add choice pieces of meat and bones, and boil it, symbolizing the city full of violence. Then God tells him his wife will die, but he must not mourn or weep, for this is a sign to the exiles—when Jerusalem falls, they too will not mourn openly but will waste away because of their sins.",
  "Ezekiel 25": "The word of the Lord comes against Ammon, Moab, Edom, and Philistia because they rejoiced over Israel's fall and the desecration of the sanctuary. God will stretch out His hand against them—giving Ammon to the people of the East, making Moab desolate, taking vengeance on Edom, and executing great vengeance on Philistia—and they will know He is the Lord when He takes vengeance on them.",
  "Ezekiel 26": "Because Tyre rejoiced over Jerusalem's fall saying 'The gate to the nations is broken,' God will bring many nations against her like the sea casting up waves. Nebuchadnezzar will come from the north with horses, chariots, and a great army, breaking down towers and walls, and Tyre will become a bare rock, a place to spread fishnets, never to be rebuilt.",
  "Ezekiel 27": "Take up a lament for Tyre, the city at the gateway to the sea, merchant of peoples on many coasts—you were perfect in beauty like a ship with planks of juniper, mast of cedar, and sails of fine embroidered linen. Your wealth and merchandise were abundant, but when your rowers bring you to high seas, the east wind will break you to pieces in the heart of the sea, and all who live by the sea will be appalled.",
  "Ezekiel 28": "The word of the Lord comes against the ruler of Tyre who says 'I am a god; I sit on the throne of a god,' yet he is a mere mortal. Because his heart is proud, God will bring foreigners against him to draw swords against his beauty and wisdom, and he will die a violent death in the heart of the seas. A lament follows for the king of Tyre, describing him as in Eden wearing precious stones until wickedness was found in him and he was cast to earth.",
  "Ezekiel 29": "In the tenth year, the word comes against Pharaoh king of Egypt: God will put hooks in his jaws and make the fish stick to his scales, pulling him out of his streams. Egypt will become a desolate wasteland because Pharaoh said 'The Nile is mine; I made it,' and after forty years of exile God will gather the Egyptians back but they will be the lowliest of kingdoms, no longer a source of confidence for Israel.",
  "Ezekiel 30": "Wail for the day, for the day of the Lord is near, a day of clouds and doom for the nations! The sword will come against Egypt, her allies will fall, and her proud strength will fail from Migdol to Aswan. God will set fire to Egypt and break the power of Pharaoh, and when He breaks Pharaoh's arms, he will groan before Nebuchadnezzar like a mortally wounded man.",
  "Ezekiel 31": "In the eleventh year, God tells Pharaoh to consider Assyria—it was once like a great cedar in Lebanon with beautiful branches providing shade, taller than all trees, but because it towered on high and its top was among the clouds with pride in its height, God handed it over to the ruler of nations who cut it down. So too will Egypt and her hordes go down to the realm of the dead with those killed by the sword.",
  "Ezekiel 32": "In the twelfth year, Ezekiel takes up a lament for Pharaoh: You are like a lion among nations, thrashing about in your streams, but God will spread His net over you and haul you up, throwing you on the land where birds and animals will gorge themselves. God will bring darkness over Egypt when He brings about her destruction, and she will lie among the uncircumcised, with those killed by the sword.",
  "Ezekiel 33": "God appoints Ezekiel as a watchman for Israel—if he sees the sword coming and does not blow the trumpet to warn the people, their blood will be on his hands, but if he warns them and they do not listen, they will die for their sin and he will have saved himself. The people say God's way is not just, but God says it is their ways that are not just, for if the righteous turn from righteousness they will die, and if the wicked turn from wickedness they will live.",
  "Ezekiel 34": "Woe to Israel's shepherds who only take care of themselves! They have not strengthened the weak, healed the sick, or searched for the lost, and the sheep were scattered with no one to search for them, becoming food for wild animals. God will search for His sheep Himself, rescue them, bring them back to their own land, and place over them one shepherd, His servant David, who will tend them.",
  "Ezekiel 35": "The word of the Lord comes against Mount Seir (Edom): Because you harbored ancient hostility and delivered Israel over to the sword in their time of disaster, God will make you desolate forever. You said 'Israel and Judah will be ours,' but God will treat you according to the anger and jealousy you showed, and you will know He is the Lord when He judges you.",
  "Ezekiel 36": "Prophesy to the mountains of Israel that God will bring people back to settle them and make them more prosperous than before, for the nations sneered and took possession of them. God will sprinkle clean water on Israel and cleanse them from impurities, give them a new heart and put a new spirit in them, removing their heart of stone and giving them a heart of flesh, and they will be His people.",
  "Ezekiel 37": "The hand of the Lord sets Ezekiel in a valley full of dry bones, and God asks if they can live. Ezekiel prophesies to the bones and they come together, then prophesies to the breath and they come to life—a vast army standing on their feet. God explains these bones are Israel who say 'Our bones are dried up and our hope is gone,' but He will open their graves, bring them back to their land, and put His Spirit in them.",
  "Ezekiel 38": "The word of the Lord comes against Gog of the land of Magog, chief prince of Meshek and Tubal, who will come from the far north with a vast army against Israel like a cloud covering the land. God will summon a sword against Gog and execute judgment with plague, bloodshed, torrents of rain, hailstones, burning sulfur, and all the nations will know He is the Lord when He shows Himself holy through Gog.",
  "Ezekiel 39": "God declares He will strike the bow from Gog's left hand and make the arrows drop from his right, and Gog will fall on the mountains of Israel with all his hordes. It will take seven months to bury the dead and seven years to burn the weapons, and God will display His glory among the nations, no longer hiding His face from Israel but pouring out His Spirit on the house of Israel.",
  "Ezekiel 40": "In the twenty-fifth year of exile, God brings Ezekiel in visions to Israel where a man with a measuring rod shows him a new temple with intricate measurements. The man measures the outer court with gates, rooms, and porticoes, then the inner court with more gates and rooms, and the temple structure itself with chambers, all following precise measurements and architectural details.",
  "Ezekiel 41": "The man brings Ezekiel to the main hall of the temple and measures its dimensions—the inner sanctuary, the side rooms, and the temple structure. There are palm trees and cherubim carved on the walls, with each cherub having two faces—the face of a human looking toward one palm tree and the face of a lion looking toward another, and the altar of wood stands before the Lord.",
  "Ezekiel 42": "The man leads Ezekiel to the outer court and shows him rooms along the north side for the priests, where they will eat the most holy offerings and store the grain offerings, sin offerings, and guilt offerings. After measuring the inside of the temple area, he leads Ezekiel to the east gate and measures the surrounding area—500 cubits on each side with a wall separating the holy from the common.",
  "Ezekiel 43": "The man brings Ezekiel to the east gate, and the glory of the God of Israel comes from the east sounding like rushing waters, and the glory of the Lord enters the temple. God's voice tells Ezekiel this is the place of His throne where He will live among the Israelites forever, and He gives detailed instructions for the altar, including a seven-day consecration period with sin offerings and burnt offerings.",
  "Ezekiel 44": "The man brings Ezekiel back to the outer gate facing east, and it is shut because the Lord entered through it, so it must remain shut. God declares that no foreigner uncircumcised in heart may enter His sanctuary, and the Levites who went astray will be temple guards, while the Levitical priests descended from Zadok will minister before Him, wearing linen garments and following specific regulations for service.",
  "Ezekiel 45": "When the land is divided, a sacred portion will be set aside for the priests and Levites with the sanctuary in the center, and the prince's land will border the sacred portion. God gives regulations for offerings—the people must provide grain for offerings, and the prince will provide burnt offerings, grain offerings, and drink offerings at festivals, and specific measurements are given for the ephah and bath.",
  "Ezekiel 46": "God gives regulations for the prince's worship—on Sabbaths and New Moons he will worship at the entrance of the inner court, and his burnt offering will be six lambs and a ram on the Sabbath. The prince will go in through the portico and out the same way, and when he makes a freewill offering, the gate will be opened for him, and specific inheritance laws are given for the prince's property.",
  "Ezekiel 47": "The man brings Ezekiel back to the temple entrance where water is flowing from under the threshold toward the east, becoming deeper until it is a river that cannot be crossed. The water flows to the Dead Sea making the salt water fresh, and wherever the river flows, everything will live with swarms of living creatures and many fish, and fruit trees will grow on both banks with leaves that will not wither and fruit that will not fail.",
  "Ezekiel 48": "This is the list of the tribes by name: Dan will have one portion in the far north, followed by Asher, Naphtali, Manasseh, Ephraim, Reuben, and Judah. The sacred portion will be in the center with the temple, and south of the sacred portion will be Benjamin, Simeon, Issachar, Zebulun, and Gad. The city will have twelve gates named after the twelve tribes, and the name of the city will be 'The Lord is There.'",
  "Daniel 1": "In the third year of Jehoiakim's reign, Nebuchadnezzar besieges Jerusalem and God delivers it into his hand along with articles from the temple. The king orders that young men from Israel's royal family be brought to serve in the palace—Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah are chosen and renamed Belteshazzar, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. They resolve not to defile themselves with royal food, eating only vegetables and water for ten days, and God gives them knowledge and understanding, and they are found ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters.",
  "Daniel 2": "Nebuchadnezzar has troubling dreams and demands his wise men tell him both the dream and its interpretation or be executed. When none can do it, Daniel asks for time and God reveals the mystery in a vision—the king dreamed of a statue with a gold head, silver chest, bronze belly, iron legs, and feet of mixed iron and clay, struck by a rock that becomes a great mountain. Daniel interprets: the statue represents successive kingdoms, and God will establish a kingdom that will never be destroyed.",
  "Daniel 3": "King Nebuchadnezzar makes a gold image ninety feet tall and commands everyone to bow down and worship it when they hear music, or be thrown into a blazing furnace. Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego refuse, saying their God can rescue them but even if He doesn't, they will not serve other gods. The king has them thrown into a furnace heated seven times hotter, but they walk around unharmed with a fourth figure like a son of the gods, and they emerge without even the smell of fire.",
  "Daniel 4": "King Nebuchadnezzar has a dream of an enormous tree that reaches heaven, providing shelter for all, but a messenger from heaven orders it cut down, leaving only a stump. Daniel interprets that the king will be driven from people to live with wild animals and eat grass like cattle until he acknowledges that the Most High is sovereign, and twelve months later it happens as prophesied, but after seven times pass, Nebuchadnezzar's sanity returns and he praises the King of heaven.",
  "Daniel 5": "King Belshazzar holds a great banquet drinking from gold goblets taken from Jerusalem's temple, and suddenly fingers of a human hand appear and write on the wall: 'MENE, MENE, TEKEL, PARSIN.' Daniel is brought in to interpret—God has numbered the days of Belshazzar's reign and brought it to an end, he has been weighed and found wanting, and his kingdom will be divided and given to the Medes and Persians, and that very night Belshazzar is slain.",
  "Daniel 6": "King Darius appoints 120 satraps with Daniel as one of three administrators over them, and Daniel so distinguishes himself that the king plans to set him over the whole kingdom. The other officials convince the king to issue a decree that anyone who prays to any god or human except the king for thirty days will be thrown into the lions' den, and when Daniel continues praying, he is thrown in, but God sends an angel who shuts the lions' mouths, and the next morning Daniel is found unharmed.",
  "Daniel 7": "In the first year of Belshazzar, Daniel has a vision of four great beasts coming out of the sea—a lion with eagle's wings, a bear with three ribs in its mouth, a leopard with four wings and four heads, and a terrifying fourth beast with iron teeth and ten horns. Daniel sees the Ancient of Days take His seat and one like a son of man coming with the clouds, given authority and sovereign power over an eternal kingdom that will never be destroyed.",
  "Daniel 8": "In the third year of Belshazzar, Daniel has a vision of a ram with two horns standing beside a canal, then a goat with a prominent horn between its eyes comes from the west and shatters the ram's horns. The goat's horn breaks off and four prominent horns grow in its place, and from one comes a little horn that grows powerful, casting down some of the starry host. Gabriel explains the ram represents Persia and Media, the goat is Greece, and the vision concerns the distant future.",
  "Daniel 9": "In the first year of Darius the Mede, Daniel understands from Jeremiah's prophecy that Jerusalem's desolation will last seventy years. He prays confessing Israel's sin and pleading for mercy, and Gabriel comes to give insight—seventy 'sevens' are decreed to finish transgression, atone for wickedness, and bring everlasting righteousness, and after the Anointed One is put to death, the people of the ruler who will come will destroy the city and sanctuary.",
  "Daniel 10": "In the third year of Cyrus, Daniel receives a revelation about a great war and has a vision beside the Tigris River—he sees a man dressed in linen with a belt of gold, face like lightning, eyes like flaming torches, and a voice like the sound of a multitude. The man touches Daniel and explains he was delayed twenty-one days by the prince of Persia but Michael came to help, and he has come to explain what will happen to Daniel's people in the future.",
  "Daniel 11": "The man continues revealing the future—kings of the south and north will wage war, with intricate details of their conflicts, alliances through marriage, and invasions. A contemptible person will arise who will invade the kingdom when people feel secure, honor the god of fortresses with gold and silver, and become very strong, but ships from the western coastlands will oppose him, and he will pitch his royal tents between the seas at the beautiful holy mountain, yet he will come to his end with no one to help him.",
  "Daniel 12": "At that time Michael the great prince will arise and there will be a time of distress unequaled since nations began, but everyone whose name is written in the book will be delivered. Multitudes who sleep in the dust will awake—some to everlasting life and some to everlasting contempt—and those who are wise will shine like the brightness of the heavens. Daniel is told to seal the words until the time of the end when many will go here and there to increase knowledge.",
  "Hosea 1": "The word of the Lord comes to Hosea son of Beeri, and God tells him to marry a promiscuous woman and have children with her, for like an adulterous wife Israel has been unfaithful to the Lord. Hosea marries Gomer daughter of Diblaim who bears him three children—Jezreel, Lo-Ruhamah (not loved), and Lo-Ammi (not my people)—symbolizing God's judgment on Israel, yet God promises a day when they will be called 'children of the living God.'",
  "Hosea 2": "God says to rebuke your mother Israel who is not His wife, for she chases after lovers giving her food, water, wool, and linen. God will block her path with thornbushes and wall her in so she cannot find her lovers, and she will return to her first husband, for it was better then than now. In that day God will betroth her to Himself forever in righteousness and justice, love and compassion, and He will show love to Lo-Ruhamah and say to Lo-Ammi 'You are my people.'",
  "Hosea 3": "The Lord tells Hosea to love his wife again though she is an adulteress, as the Lord loves the Israelites though they turn to other gods. Hosea buys her back for fifteen shekels of silver and tells her to live with him many days without prostitution or another man, just as Israel will live many days without king or sacrifice or sacred stones, but afterward they will return and seek the Lord their God and David their king, coming trembling to the Lord and His blessings in the last days.",
  "Hosea 4": "The Lord has a charge to bring against Israel—there is no faithfulness, love, or acknowledgment of God in the land, only cursing, lying, murder, stealing, and adultery. Because the people reject knowledge, God will reject them as priests, and the more priests there were, the more they sinned, so He will punish them for their ways, for a spirit of prostitution leads them astray and they are unfaithful to their God.",
  "Hosea 5": "Hear this, priests and house of Israel! Judgment is coming because you have been a snare at Mizpah and a net spread on Tabor, and Ephraim is given to prostitution. Their deeds do not permit them to return to God because a spirit of prostitution is in their heart, and when they go with their flocks to seek the Lord, they will not find Him for He has withdrawn, and God will tear them like a lion until they admit their guilt and seek His face.",
  "Hosea 6": "Come, let us return to the Lord—He has torn us to pieces but He will heal us; He has injured us but He will bind up our wounds. After two days He will revive us, on the third day He will restore us that we may live in His presence, yet your love is like morning mist, so what can God do with you? For He desires mercy not sacrifice, acknowledgment of God rather than burnt offerings, but they have broken the covenant like Adam.",
  "Hosea 7": "Whenever God would heal Israel, the sins of Ephraim are exposed—they practice deceit, thieves break into houses, bandits rob in the streets, and they do not realize God remembers their evil deeds. They are all adulterers, hot as an oven, and Ephraim mixes with the nations becoming a flat loaf not turned over, and foreigners sap his strength yet he does not realize it, for they do not return to the Lord or seek Him.",
  "Hosea 8": "Put the trumpet to your lips! An eagle is over the house of the Lord because they have broken the covenant and rebelled against His law. Israel cries out 'Our God, we acknowledge You!' yet they set up kings without God's consent and make idols from their silver and gold. They sow the wind and reap the whirlwind—though they build many altars for sin offerings, they have become altars for sinning, and Israel will return to Egypt.",
  "Hosea 9": "Do not rejoice, Israel, with exultation like the nations, for you have been unfaithful to your God. Ephraim will return to Egypt and eat unclean food in Assyria with no wine offerings to please the Lord, and they will become wanderers among the nations. Because of their great wickedness and hostility, the days of punishment are coming, and Ephraim is blighted—even if they bear children, God will slay their cherished offspring.",
  "Hosea 10": "Israel was a spreading vine that yielded fruit for himself, but the more his fruit increased, the more altars he built. Their heart is deceitful and now they must bear their guilt—the Lord will demolish their altars and destroy their sacred stones. Sow righteousness for yourselves, reap the fruit of unfailing love, and break up your unplowed ground, for it is time to seek the Lord until He comes and showers righteousness on you.",
  "Hosea 11": "When Israel was a child, God loved him and called His son out of Egypt, teaching Ephraim to walk and taking them in His arms, but the more God called Israel, the further they went from Him. How can God give them up or hand them over? His heart recoils within Him and His compassion is aroused, for He is God and not a mere mortal, the Holy One among them, and they will follow the Lord who will roar like a lion.",
  "Hosea 12": "Ephraim feeds on the wind, pursues the east wind all day, and multiplies lies and violence, making a treaty with Assyria and sending olive oil to Egypt. The Lord has a charge to bring against Judah and will punish Jacob according to his ways, for Jacob grasped his brother's heel in the womb and struggled with God as a man, weeping and begging for His favor, so return to your God, maintain love and justice, and wait for Him always.",
  "Hosea 13": "When Ephraim spoke, people trembled for he was exalted in Israel, but he became guilty of Baal worship and died. Now they sin more and more, making idols from their silver, yet they will be like morning mist, like dew that disappears, like chaff swirling from a threshing floor, like smoke escaping through a window. God has been their God since Egypt, yet they forgot Him, so He will pounce on them like a lion, but He will ransom them from the power of the grave.",
  "Hosea 14": "Return, Israel, to the Lord your God, for your sins have been your downfall. Take words with you and return saying 'Forgive all our sins and receive us graciously,' for Assyria cannot save and idols cannot help. God responds that He will heal their waywardness and love them freely, His anger turning away, and Israel will blossom like a lily, taking root like Lebanon's cedars. Who is wise? Let them realize these things—the ways of the Lord are right, and the righteous walk in them.",
  "Joel 1": "The word of the Lord comes to Joel son of Pethuel: Hear this, you elders! Has anything like this ever happened? Tell it to your children and let them tell their children—what the locust swarm has left, the great locusts have eaten, and what the great locusts have left, the young locusts have eaten. Wake up and weep, all you drunkards, for the new wine is taken from your lips, and a nation has invaded the land with teeth of a lion, devastating vines and fig trees.",
  "Joel 2": "Blow the trumpet in Zion and sound the alarm on God's holy hill, for the day of the Lord is coming—a day of darkness and gloom with a large and mighty army before whom the earth shakes and the heavens tremble. Even now, declares the Lord, return to Me with all your heart, with fasting, weeping, and mourning, for He is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and abounding in love, and He will pour out His Spirit on all people—your sons and daughters will prophesy, old men will dream dreams, and young men will see visions.",
  "Joel 3": "In those days when God restores the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem, He will gather all nations to the Valley of Jehoshaphat and enter into judgment with them for scattering His people and dividing His land. Proclaim this among the nations: Prepare for war, beat your plowshares into swords and pruning hooks into spears, for multitudes wait in the valley of decision where the Lord will roar from Zion, but Judah will be inhabited forever and the Lord will dwell in Zion.",
  "Amos 1": "The words of Amos, a shepherd from Tekoa, who prophesied two years before the earthquake during the reigns of Uzziah and Jeroboam: The Lord roars from Zion and thunders from Jerusalem. He declares judgment against Damascus, Gaza, Tyre, Edom, and Ammon for their atrocities—threshing Gilead with iron sledges, carrying whole communities into exile, breaking treaties, pursuing brothers with swords, and ripping open pregnant women to extend borders.",
  "Amos 2": "The Lord continues pronouncing judgment—against Moab for burning the bones of Edom's king to lime, and against Judah for rejecting His law and following false gods. But His fiercest words are for Israel: You oppress the righteous, take bribes, deny justice to the poor, and father and son use the same girl, profaning His holy name. You made the Nazirites drink wine and commanded prophets not to prophesy, so I will crush you as a cart crushes when loaded with grain.",
  "Amos 3": "Hear this word the Lord has spoken against you, people of Israel, against the whole family I brought up out of Egypt: You only have I chosen of all the families of the earth, therefore I will punish you for all your sins. Can two walk together unless they have agreed to do so? Does a lion roar when it has no prey? The Sovereign Lord does nothing without revealing His plan to His prophets, and when disaster comes to a city, has not the Lord caused it?",
  "Amos 4": "Hear this word, you cows of Bashan on Mount Samaria, you women who oppress the poor and crush the needy and say to your husbands 'Bring us some drinks!' The Sovereign Lord declares He will take you away with hooks, through breaks in the wall you will be led out, and you will be thrown toward Harmon. God withheld rain, struck gardens with blight and mildew, sent plagues and killed your young men in battle, yet you have not returned to Me, so prepare to meet your God, Israel.",
  "Amos 5": "Hear this word, Israel, this lament I take up concerning you: Fallen is Virgin Israel, never to rise again, deserted in her own land with no one to lift her up. Seek the Lord and live, or He will sweep through the tribes of Joseph like fire, for you have turned justice into bitterness and cast righteousness to the ground. I hate, I despise your religious festivals and assemblies—take away the noise of your songs, but let justice roll on like a river and righteousness like a never-failing stream!",
  "Amos 6": "Woe to you who are complacent in Zion and feel secure on Mount Samaria, you notable men of the foremost nation! You lie on beds adorned with ivory, dine on choice lambs and fattened calves, strum on harps, drink wine by the bowlful, and use the finest lotions, but you do not grieve over the ruin of Joseph. Therefore you will be among the first to go into exile, and your feasting and lounging will end.",
  "Amos 7": "This is what the Sovereign Lord showed Amos: He was preparing swarms of locusts, then a fire that consumed the land, but when Amos pleaded, God relented. Then God showed him a plumb line—He will spare Israel no longer, and the high places of Isaac will be destroyed. Amaziah the priest tells King Jeroboam that Amos is conspiring and orders him to leave, but Amos replies he was no prophet but a shepherd whom the Lord took and said 'Go, prophesy to my people Israel.'",
  "Amos 8": "This is what the Sovereign Lord showed Amos: a basket of ripe fruit, declaring 'The time is ripe for my people Israel; I will spare them no longer.' The songs in the temple will turn to wailing, and dead bodies will be everywhere, for you trample the needy and do away with the poor, using dishonest scales and selling even the sweepings with the wheat. The days are coming when God will send a famine—not of food or water, but of hearing the words of the Lord.",
  "Amos 9": "I saw the Lord standing by the altar saying 'Strike the tops of the pillars so that the thresholds shake,' and not one will get away—though they dig down to the depths below or climb up to the heavens, God's hand will take them. Yet He will not totally destroy the descendants of Jacob, for in that day He will restore David's fallen shelter, repair its broken walls, and rebuild its ruins, and they will possess the remnant of Edom and all the nations that bear His name.",
  "Obadiah 1": "The vision of Obadiah concerning Edom: The Lord says 'I will make you small among the nations; you will be utterly despised.' The pride of your heart has deceived you, you who live in the clefts of the rocks and say 'Who can bring me down to the ground?' Though you soar like the eagle, I will bring you down. Because of violence against your brother Jacob, you will be covered with shame and destroyed forever, for you stood aloof when strangers carried off his wealth, and the day of the Lord is near for all nations—as you have done, it will be done to you, but on Mount Zion will be deliverance and the kingdom will be the Lord's.",
  "Jonah 1": "The word of the Lord comes to Jonah telling him to go to Nineveh and preach against it, but Jonah flees to Tarshish instead, boarding a ship. The Lord sends a violent storm, and the sailors cast lots to find who is responsible—the lot falls on Jonah who tells them to throw him into the sea. They reluctantly do so and the storm ceases, and the Lord provides a huge fish to swallow Jonah, and he remains in its belly three days and three nights.",
  "Jonah 2": "From inside the fish Jonah prays to the Lord, saying 'In my distress I called to the Lord and He answered me, from deep in the realm of the dead I called for help and You listened to my cry.' The engulfing waters threatened him, seaweed was wrapped around his head, but when his life was ebbing away, he remembered the Lord, and his prayer rose to God's holy temple. What he has vowed he will make good—salvation comes from the Lord—and the Lord commands the fish to vomit Jonah onto dry land.",
  "Jonah 3": "The word of the Lord comes to Jonah a second time telling him to go to Nineveh and proclaim the message God gives him. Jonah obeys, goes to the great city requiring three days to go through it, and proclaims 'Forty more days and Nineveh will be overthrown.' The Ninevites believe God, declare a fast, and put on sackcloth from the greatest to the least, and when God sees how they turn from their evil ways, He relents and does not bring the destruction He had threatened.",
  "Jonah 4": "Jonah is greatly displeased and angry that God spared Nineveh, saying he knew God was gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and abounding in love, and he'd rather die than live. The Lord asks 'Is it right for you to be angry?' Jonah goes east of the city where God provides a leafy plant that grows up over him for shade, making Jonah very happy, but the next day God provides a worm that chews the plant so it withers, and God says if Jonah is concerned about a plant, should He not be concerned about Nineveh with 120,000 people who cannot tell their right hand from their left?",
  "Micah 1": "The word of the Lord comes to Micah concerning Samaria and Jerusalem: Look! The Lord is coming from His dwelling place to tread on the heights of the earth, and the mountains melt beneath Him and valleys split apart. All this is because of Jacob's transgression and Israel's sins—Samaria will become a heap of rubble, and her idols will be destroyed. Micah will weep and wail, going barefoot and naked, for Jerusalem's wound is incurable and has reached the very gate of His people.",
  "Micah 2": "Woe to those who plan iniquity and work evil on their beds! At morning's light they carry it out because it is in their power to do it, coveting fields and seizing houses, oppressing people and their inheritance. Therefore God will devise disaster against them from which they cannot save themselves, and He will take away their fields. The prophets say 'Do not prophesy,' but the Lord will gather the remnant of Israel like sheep in a pen, and their King will pass through before them, the Lord at their head.",
  "Micah 3": "Then Micah says: Listen, leaders of Jacob, you who hate good and love evil, who tear the skin from my people and break their bones in pieces! You will cry out to the Lord, but He will not answer because of the evil you have done. As for the prophets who lead my people astray, proclaiming peace when they have something to eat but war against those who put nothing in their mouths—because of you, Zion will be plowed like a field, Jerusalem will become a heap of rubble, and the temple hill a mound overgrown with thickets.",
  "Micah 4": "In the last days the mountain of the Lord's temple will be established as the highest of the mountains and raised above the hills, and all nations will stream to it. They will beat their swords into plowshares and spears into pruning hooks, and nation will not take up sword against nation or train for war anymore. Though the people walk in the names of their gods, Israel will walk in the name of the Lord forever, and He will gather the lame and those driven away, and the Lord will rule over them in Mount Zion from that day and forever.",
  "Micah 5": "Marshal your troops now, city of troops, for a siege is laid against us—they will strike Israel's ruler on the cheek with a rod. But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come for Me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times. He will stand and shepherd His flock in the strength of the Lord, and they will live securely, for then His greatness will reach to the ends of the earth, and He will be our peace.",
  "Micah 6": "Listen to what the Lord says: Stand up, plead your case before the mountains, and let the hills hear what you have to say. What have I done to make you weary of Me? I brought you up out of Egypt and sent Moses, Aaron, and Miriam to lead you. With what shall I come before the Lord? Shall I come with burnt offerings, with thousands of rams? He has shown you what is good—what does the Lord require of you but to act justly, love mercy, and walk humbly with your God?",
  "Micah 7": "What misery is mine! I am like one who gathers summer fruit at the gleaning of the vineyard—there is no cluster to eat, and the godly have been swept from the land. Do not trust a neighbor or put confidence in a friend, for a son dishonors his father and a man's enemies are the members of his own household. But as for me, I watch in hope for the Lord, I wait for God my Savior, and He will hear me. Who is a God like You, who pardons sin and forgives transgression? You will again have compassion on us and hurl all our iniquities into the depths of the sea.",
  "Nahum 1": "A prophecy concerning Nineveh—the Lord is a jealous and avenging God who takes vengeance on His foes and vents His wrath against His enemies. The Lord is slow to anger but great in power, and He will not leave the guilty unpunished, His way is in the whirlwind and storm, and clouds are the dust of His feet. Who can withstand His indignation or endure His fierce anger? Yet the Lord is good, a refuge in times of trouble, and He cares for those who trust in Him.",
  "Nahum 2": "An attacker advances against you, Nineveh! Guard the fortress, watch the road, brace yourselves, marshal all your strength! The shields of the soldiers are red, the warriors are clad in scarlet, and metal on the chariots flashes on the day they are made ready. The river gates are thrown open and the palace collapses, and it is decreed that Nineveh be exiled and carried away, though she was like a pool whose water is draining away, for the Lord will restore the splendor of Jacob.",
  "Nahum 3": "Woe to the city of blood, full of lies and plunder, never without victims! The crack of whips, the clatter of wheels, galloping horses and jolting chariots! I am against you, declares the Lord Almighty, and I will lift your skirts over your face and show the nations your nakedness. All who see you will flee from you saying 'Nineveh is in ruins'—are you better than Thebes that was situated by the Nile with water surrounding her? Nothing can heal you, and your wound is fatal, for who has not felt your endless cruelty?",
  "Habakkuk 1": "The prophet Habakkuk complains: How long, Lord, must I call for help and You do not listen or cry out about violence but You do not save? Why do You make me look at injustice and tolerate wrongdoing? The Lord answers that He is raising up the Babylonians, that ruthless and impetuous people who sweep across the earth to seize dwellings not their own. Habakkuk responds: Your eyes are too pure to look on evil, so why do You tolerate the treacherous and remain silent while the wicked swallow up those more righteous than themselves?",
  "Habakkuk 2": "Habakkuk says he will stand at his watch and station himself on the ramparts to see what God will say. The Lord answers: Write down the revelation and make it plain on tablets—though it linger, wait for it, for the righteous person will live by his faithfulness. Woe to him who builds his house by unjust gain, who plunders many nations, and to him who builds a city with bloodshed! For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord as the waters cover the sea.",
  "Habakkuk 3": "Habakkuk's prayer: Lord, I have heard of Your fame and stand in awe of Your deeds—repeat them in our day! God comes from Teman and the Holy One from Mount Paran, His glory covers the heavens, His splendor fills the earth, and His brilliance is like the sunrise. Though the fig tree does not bud and there are no grapes on the vines, though the olive crop fails and fields produce no food, yet I will rejoice in the Lord and be joyful in God my Savior, for the Sovereign Lord is my strength.",
  "Zephaniah 1": "The word of the Lord comes to Zephaniah during the reign of Josiah: I will sweep away everything from the face of the earth, and I will stretch out My hand against Judah and Jerusalem to destroy every remnant of Baal worship. The great day of the Lord is near—it will be a day of wrath, distress, anguish, trouble, ruin, darkness, gloom, clouds, and blackness, and neither their silver nor gold will be able to save them on the day of the Lord's wrath.",
  "Zephaniah 2": "Gather together, shameful nation, before the decree takes effect and the day passes like windblown chaff! Seek the Lord, all you humble of the land who do what He commands—seek righteousness, seek humility, perhaps you will be sheltered on the day of the Lord's anger. Gaza will be abandoned, Ashkelon left in ruins, Moab will become like Sodom and Ammon like Gomorrah, Cush will be slain by God's sword, and He will stretch out His hand against Assyria leaving Nineveh utterly desolate.",
  "Zephaniah 3": "Woe to the city of oppressors, rebellious and defiled! She obeys no one, accepts no correction, does not trust in the Lord or draw near to her God. Her officials are roaring lions, her rulers evening wolves, her prophets unprincipled, and her priests profane the sanctuary. Yet the Lord says: I will leave within you the meek and humble who trust in My name—the remnant of Israel will tell no lies, and a deceitful tongue will not be found in their mouths. Sing, Daughter Zion, shout aloud, Israel! The Lord has taken away your punishment and turned back your enemy.",
  "Haggai 1": "In the second year of King Darius, the word of the Lord comes through Haggai to Zerubbabel the governor and Joshua the high priest: This people says 'The time has not yet come to rebuild the Lord's house,' yet you live in paneled houses while this house remains a ruin. You have planted much but harvested little, you eat but never have enough, and your wages go into a purse with holes—consider your ways! Go up into the mountains, bring down timber, and build the house, and the Lord stirs up their spirits to work.",
  "Haggai 2": "The word of the Lord comes again: Who of you is left who saw this house in its former glory? How does it look to you now? Does it not seem like nothing? But be strong and work, for I am with you, and in a little while I will shake the heavens and earth, and the desired of all nations will come, and I will fill this house with glory. The glory of this present house will be greater than the glory of the former house, and in this place I will grant peace.",
  "Zechariah 1": "In the eighth month of the second year of Darius, the word of the Lord comes to Zechariah: Return to Me, and I will return to you, says the Lord, and do not be like your ancestors who did not listen. Zechariah has a vision of a man riding a red horse among myrtle trees in a ravine with red, brown, and white horses behind him—they report that the whole world is at rest and peace. The Lord declares He is very jealous for Jerusalem and angry with the nations that feel secure, for while He was only a little angry, they went too far with punishment.",
  "Zechariah 2": "Zechariah looks up and sees a man with a measuring line going to measure Jerusalem, but an angel tells him to run and say that Jerusalem will be a city without walls because of the great number of people and animals in it, and the Lord Himself will be a wall of fire around it and its glory within. Shout and be glad, Daughter Zion, for I am coming and will live among you, and many nations will be joined with the Lord in that day and become His people.",
  "Zechariah 3": "Zechariah sees Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the Lord, and Satan standing at his right side to accuse him. The Lord rebukes Satan saying 'The Lord who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Is not this man a burning stick snatched from the fire?' Joshua is dressed in filthy clothes, but the angel orders the filthy clothes removed and rich garments put on him, and a clean turban placed on his head, and the angel declares that if Joshua walks in God's ways, the Lord will bring His servant, the Branch.",
  "Zechariah 4": "The angel wakes Zechariah and asks what he sees—a solid gold lampstand with a bowl at the top and seven lamps, and two olive trees beside it. The angel explains this is the word of the Lord to Zerubbabel: Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit. What are you, mighty mountain? Before Zerubbabel you will become level ground, and he will bring out the capstone with shouts of 'God bless it!' for the hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation and will complete it.",
  "Zechariah 5": "Zechariah looks again and sees a flying scroll, thirty feet long and fifteen feet wide, which is the curse going out over the whole land against thieves and those who swear falsely. Then he sees a basket with a woman inside representing wickedness, and she is pushed back down and covered with a lead cover, and two women with wings like storks carry the basket to Babylonia to build a house for it, and when ready, the basket will be set there in its place.",
  "Zechariah 6": "Zechariah sees four chariots coming from between two mountains—the first with red horses, second with black horses, third with white horses, and fourth with dappled horses, going out to the four spirits of heaven. The angel says they are going throughout the earth, and the one going toward the north country will give God's Spirit rest there. Then God tells Zechariah to take silver and gold and make a crown for Joshua the high priest, declaring he will be called the Branch who will build the Lord's temple and bear royal honor.",
  "Zechariah 7": "In the fourth year of King Darius, people from Bethel send men to ask the priests and prophets: Should we mourn and fast in the fifth month as we have done for years? The word of the Lord comes asking: When you fasted and mourned, was it really for Me? And when you ate and drank, were you not just feasting for yourselves? The Lord told your ancestors to administer true justice, show mercy and compassion, do not oppress the widow or fatherless, but they refused to pay attention and turned their backs stubbornly.",
  "Zechariah 8": "The word of the Lord Almighty comes: I am very jealous for Zion and burning with jealousy for her. This is what the Lord says: I will return to Zion and dwell in Jerusalem, which will be called the Faithful City. Once again men and women of ripe old age will sit in Jerusalem's streets with cane in hand because of their age, and the city streets will be filled with boys and girls playing. The fasts of the fourth, fifth, seventh, and tenth months will become joyful and glad occasions—therefore love truth and peace.",
  "Zechariah 9": "A prophecy declares judgment on Damascus, Hamath, Tyre, and Sidon, and the cities of Philistia—they will be destroyed and their wealth carried off. But rejoice greatly, Daughter Zion! See, your King comes to you, righteous and victorious, lowly and riding on a donkey, on a colt the foal of a donkey. He will proclaim peace to the nations, His rule will extend from sea to sea and from the River to the ends of the earth, and the Lord will appear over them, His arrow flashing like lightning.",
  "Zechariah 10": "Ask the Lord for rain in the springtime, for it is the Lord who sends the thunderstorms. The idols speak deceitfully and diviners see visions that lie, so the people wander like sheep oppressed for lack of a shepherd, and God's anger burns against the shepherds. Yet He will care for His flock and make them like a proud horse in battle, and the cornerstone and tent peg will come from Judah—they will be like warriors trampling their enemies in the mud of the streets.",
  "Zechariah 11": "Open your doors, Lebanon, that fire may devour your cedars! Wail, you juniper, for the cedar has fallen and the stately trees are ruined! The Lord tells Zechariah to shepherd the flock marked for slaughter whose buyers kill them and go unpunished. He takes two staffs, one called Favor and one called Union, but breaks both staffs symbolizing the breaking of God's covenant and the breaking of brotherhood between Judah and Israel. Then he takes the wages of thirty pieces of silver and throws them to the potter in the house of the Lord.",
  "Zechariah 12": "A prophecy concerning Israel: The Lord who stretches out the heavens and forms the human spirit within a person declares He will make Jerusalem an immovable rock for all nations—all who try to move it will injure themselves. On that day God will strike every horse with panic and every rider with madness, but He will watch over Judah, and they will be like a firepot among wood or a flaming torch among sheaves, consuming all surrounding peoples right and left, and God will pour out a spirit of grace and supplication on David's house and Jerusalem's inhabitants.",
  "Zechariah 13": "On that day a fountain will be opened for David's house and Jerusalem's inhabitants to cleanse them from sin and impurity. I will remove the prophets and spirit of impurity from the land, and if anyone still prophesies, their own parents will say 'You must die because you have told lies in the Lord's name,' and they will pierce them. Strike the shepherd and the sheep will be scattered, and God will turn His hand against the little ones—two-thirds will be struck down and die, but one-third will be left and refined like silver and tested like gold.",
  "Zechariah 14": "A day of the Lord is coming when Jerusalem will be captured, houses ransacked, and women raped, and half the city will go into exile. Then the Lord will go out and fight against those nations, and His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives which will be split in two from east to west forming a great valley. On that day there will be no light or cold or frost—it will be a unique day with no daytime or nighttime, and living water will flow from Jerusalem. The Lord will be King over the whole earth—on that day there will be one Lord and His name the only name.",
  "Malachi 1": "A prophecy—the word of the Lord to Israel through Malachi: I have loved you, says the Lord, but you ask 'How have You loved us?' Was not Esau Jacob's brother? Yet I have loved Jacob but Esau I have hated. A son honors his father and a servant his master—if I am a father, where is the honor due Me? You bring blind, lame, and diseased animals for sacrifice—would your governor be pleased with that? Oh, that one of you would shut the temple doors so you would not light useless fires on My altar!",
  "Malachi 2": "And now, you priests, this warning is for you—if you do not honor My name, I will send a curse on you. You have violated the covenant with Levi and caused many to stumble by your teaching. Have we not all one Father? Did not one God create us? Why do we profane the covenant by being unfaithful to one another? Judah has desecrated the sanctuary the Lord loves by marrying women who worship foreign gods. I hate divorce, says the Lord God of Israel, so do not be unfaithful to the wife of your youth.",
  "Malachi 3": "I will send My messenger who will prepare the way before Me, and then suddenly the Lord you are seeking will come to His temple—the messenger of the covenant whom you desire will come. But who can endure the day of His coming? For He will be like a refiner's fire purifying the Levites. Will a mere mortal rob God? Yet you rob Me in tithes and offerings—bring the whole tithe into the storehouse that there may be food in My house, and test Me in this and see if I will not throw open the floodgates of heaven and pour out so much blessing there will not be room enough to store it.",
  "Malachi 4": "Surely the day is coming burning like a furnace when all the arrogant and evildoers will be stubble, and that day will set them on fire leaving them neither root nor branch. But for you who revere My name, the sun of righteousness will rise with healing in its rays, and you will go out and frolic like well-fed calves, trampling down the wicked who will be ashes under the soles of your feet. Remember the law of My servant Moses, and see, I will send the prophet Elijah before that great and dreadful day of the Lord comes, and he will turn the hearts of the parents to their children and the hearts of the children to their parents.",
  "Matthew 1": "Matthew traces Jesus' genealogy from Abraham through David to Joseph, establishing Jesus as the legal heir to David's throne and the fulfillment of God's covenant promises. The angel announces to Joseph that Mary will bear a son conceived by the Holy Spirit, and he is to name Him Jesus (meaning 'the Lord saves'), for He will save His people from their sins, fulfilling Isaiah's prophecy about Immanuel—'God with us.'",
  "Matthew 2": "Wise men from the east follow a star to Jerusalem seeking the newborn King of the Jews, and Herod directs them to Bethlehem where they worship Jesus and present gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh. Warned in a dream, they return home another way, and an angel tells Joseph to flee to Egypt because Herod plans to kill the child, and after Herod's death, they return and settle in Nazareth, fulfilling multiple prophecies.",
  "Matthew 3": "John the Baptist appears in the wilderness of Judea preaching 'Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near,' baptizing with water for repentance while confronting the religious leaders as a brood of vipers. Jesus comes from Galilee to be baptized by John, who protests, but Jesus insists to 'fulfill all righteousness,' and when He comes up from the water, the heavens open, the Spirit descends like a dove, and the Father's voice declares 'This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.'",
  "Matthew 4": "Jesus is led by the Spirit into the wilderness where He fasts forty days and is tempted by Satan three times—to turn stones to bread, to throw Himself from the temple, and to worship Satan for all the kingdoms—but Jesus resists each with Scripture. After John is imprisoned, Jesus begins His ministry in Galilee proclaiming 'Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near,' and He calls His first disciples—Simon Peter, Andrew, James, and John—who immediately leave their nets to follow Him.",
  "Matthew 5": "Jesus goes up on a mountainside and teaches the Beatitudes—blessed are the poor in spirit, those who mourn, the meek, those who hunger for righteousness, the merciful, the pure in heart, the peacemakers, and the persecuted. He declares His followers are the salt of the earth and light of the world, and He has not come to abolish the Law but to fulfill it. He teaches about anger and murder, lust and adultery, divorce, oaths, retaliation ('turn the other cheek'), and loving enemies, commanding His followers to be perfect as their heavenly Father is perfect.",
  "Matthew 6": "Jesus teaches about giving to the needy in secret, praying in private rather than to be seen by others, and provides the Lord's Prayer as a model. He teaches about fasting without making it obvious, storing up treasures in heaven rather than on earth where moth and rust destroy, and warns that no one can serve two masters—you cannot serve both God and money. He commands not to worry about life, food, drink, or clothing, for your heavenly Father knows what you need, so seek first His kingdom and righteousness and these things will be given to you.",
  "Matthew 7": "Jesus teaches not to judge others or you will be judged by the same measure, and first remove the plank from your own eye before trying to remove the speck from your brother's. He promises that everyone who asks receives, who seeks finds, and to those who knock the door will be opened, for your Father in heaven gives good gifts to those who ask. Enter through the narrow gate that leads to life, beware of false prophets who are wolves in sheep's clothing, and those who hear His words and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock.",
  "Matthew 8": "Jesus comes down from the mountain and cleanses a leper with a touch, then heals the centurion's paralyzed servant from a distance, marveling at the centurion's faith which surpasses any He has found in Israel. He heals Peter's mother-in-law and many demon-possessed people, fulfilling Isaiah's prophecy, and He teaches about the cost of discipleship—foxes have dens but the Son of Man has no place to lay His head. He calms a furious storm on the sea with a word, and the disciples marvel 'What kind of man is this? Even the winds and waves obey him!' He casts demons out of two men into a herd of pigs.",
  "Matthew 9": "Jesus heals a paralyzed man, first forgiving his sins, demonstrating that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins. He calls Matthew the tax collector to follow Him and eats with tax collectors and sinners, explaining that He came not to call the righteous but sinners, and teaches about fasting, new wine, and new wineskins. He heals a woman who had been bleeding for twelve years and raises Jairus's daughter from the dead, gives sight to two blind men who proclaim His fame throughout the region, and heals a mute demon-possessed man, but the Pharisees claim He drives out demons by the prince of demons.",
  "Matthew 10": "Jesus gives His twelve apostles authority to drive out impure spirits and heal every disease and sickness, naming them: Simon Peter, Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew, Thomas, Matthew, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot. He sends them to the lost sheep of Israel with instructions: proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is near, heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse lepers, drive out demons, take no money or extra provisions, and whoever does not receive you, shake the dust off your feet. He warns they will be persecuted, handed over to councils, flogged, and brought before governors, but the Spirit will speak through them, and whoever stands firm to the end will be saved.",
  "Matthew 11": "When John the Baptist sends disciples to ask if Jesus is the Messiah, Jesus points to His miracles as evidence and declares John is the greatest born of women, yet the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. Jesus denounces the unrepentant cities where He performed most miracles—Chorazin, Bethsaida, and Capernaum—declaring it will be more bearable for Sodom on judgment day. He praises the Father for hiding these things from the wise and revealing them to little children, then issues His famous invitation: 'Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.'",
  "Matthew 12": "The Pharisees accuse Jesus' disciples of breaking the Sabbath by picking grain, and Jesus responds that the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath, then heals a man's withered hand on the Sabbath, fulfilling Isaiah's prophecy about the gentle servant. When Jesus casts out a demon, the Pharisees claim He does it by Beelzebul, and Jesus warns that blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven, that a tree is known by its fruit, and every careless word will be judged. He declares that no sign will be given except the sign of Jonah—as Jonah was three days in the fish, so the Son of Man will be three days in the earth—and true family are those who do the will of the Father.",
  "Matthew 13": "Jesus teaches in parables by the lake: the parable of the sower whose seed falls on different soils representing different responses to the word, the parable of the weeds among wheat explaining that both will grow until the harvest, the parables of the mustard seed and yeast showing the kingdom's growth. He explains the parable of the weeds—the field is the world, good seed are kingdom sons, weeds are sons of the evil one, and at the end the angels will separate them. He shares parables of the hidden treasure, the pearl of great value, and the net catching all kinds of fish, and the people of His hometown take offense at Him.",
  "Matthew 14": "Herod beheads John the Baptist after John condemned his marriage to Herodias, and Herodias's daughter requests John's head on a platter. When Jesus hears the news, He withdraws by boat to a solitary place, but crowds follow, and He has compassion, heals their sick, then feeds five thousand men plus women and children with five loaves and two fish, with twelve baskets of leftovers. He sends the disciples ahead across the lake, and in the early morning walks on the water to them, and when Peter asks to come to Him on the water, Peter walks briefly but begins to sink when he doubts, and Jesus reaches out to save him.",
  "Matthew 15": "Pharisees and teachers of the law criticize Jesus' disciples for not washing hands before eating, and Jesus exposes their hypocrisy—they honor God with their lips but break God's commands by their traditions, nullifying God's word for the sake of tradition. He teaches that what goes into the mouth does not defile, but what comes out of the heart—evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony, and slander. A Canaanite woman begs Jesus to heal her demon-possessed daughter, and when she persists despite His testing, Jesus commends her great faith and heals her daughter, then He heals many and feeds four thousand with seven loaves and a few fish.",
  "Matthew 16": "The Pharisees and Sadducees demand a sign from heaven, and Jesus warns them no sign will be given except Jonah's, then warns His disciples about the yeast of the Pharisees—their teaching. When Jesus asks who people say He is, Peter declares 'You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God,' and Jesus blesses him, saying on this rock He will build His church and gives him the keys of the kingdom. Jesus then predicts His death and resurrection for the first time, and when Peter rebukes Him, Jesus says 'Get behind me, Satan!' He teaches that those who want to follow Him must deny themselves, take up their cross, and whoever loses their life for Him will find it.",
  "Matthew 17": "Jesus takes Peter, James, and John up a high mountain where He is transfigured—His face shines like the sun and His clothes become white as light—and Moses and Elijah appear talking with Him. A voice from the cloud declares 'This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased. Listen to him!' Jesus tells them not to tell anyone until He rises from the dead, and He comes down to heal a demon-possessed boy whom the disciples could not heal because of their little faith. Jesus again predicts His death and resurrection, then provides a miracle coin from a fish's mouth to pay the temple tax.",
  "Matthew 18": "When the disciples ask who is greatest in the kingdom of heaven, Jesus calls a little child, saying unless you change and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom, and whoever welcomes such a child welcomes Him. He warns about causing little ones to stumble—better to have a millstone hung around your neck and be drowned—and teaches to confront a sinning brother privately, then with witnesses, then tell the church. He teaches about binding and loosing, promises that where two or three gather in His name He is with them, and tells Peter to forgive not seven times but seventy-seven times, illustrating with the parable of the unmerciful servant.",
  "Matthew 19": "Pharisees test Jesus about divorce, and He teaches that God made them male and female from the beginning, a man leaves father and mother to be united with his wife as one flesh, and Moses permitted divorce because of hard hearts, but 'what God has joined together, let no one separate.' Little children are brought to Jesus and He blesses them, saying the kingdom belongs to such as these, then the rich young ruler asks about eternal life, and Jesus tells him to sell his possessions and follow Him, but he goes away sad, and Jesus says it's easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for the rich to enter heaven.",
  "Matthew 20": "Jesus tells the parable of the workers in the vineyard hired at different times but all receiving the same wage, teaching that the last will be first and the first last. He predicts His death and resurrection a third time, saying the Son of Man will be betrayed, mocked, flogged, and crucified, but will rise on the third day. When James and John's mother asks for her sons to sit at His right and left in His kingdom, Jesus teaches that whoever wants to be great must be a servant, for the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve and give His life as a ransom for many, then He heals two blind men near Jericho.",
  "Matthew 21": "Jesus enters Jerusalem on a donkey, fulfilling Zechariah's prophecy, and crowds spread cloaks and palm branches, shouting 'Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!' He cleanses the temple, overturning money changers' tables and declaring 'My house will be called a house of prayer, but you are making it a den of robbers.' He curses a fig tree that withers immediately, teaches about faith that moves mountains, and when religious leaders question His authority, He tells the parables of the two sons and the tenants who kill the vineyard owner's son, revealing they are rejecting Him.",
  "Matthew 22": "Jesus tells the parable of the wedding banquet where invited guests refuse to come, so the king sends servants to invite anyone they can find, but one guest without wedding clothes is thrown out. Pharisees try to trap Jesus with questions about paying taxes to Caesar ('Give back to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's'), Sadducees question Him about resurrection and marriage (God is the God of the living), and a Pharisee asks which is the greatest commandment—Jesus answers: love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, and mind, and love your neighbor as yourself, then He asks them whose son the Messiah is.",
  "Matthew 23": "Jesus warns the crowds and disciples about the teachers of the law and Pharisees who do not practice what they preach, love places of honor, and burden people with heavy loads. He pronounces seven woes against them: you shut the door of the kingdom in people's faces, you travel to make converts who become sons of hell, you are blind guides with twisted priorities about oaths, you give a tenth but neglect justice and mercy, you clean the outside but are full of greed and self-indulgence, you are like whitewashed tombs beautiful outside but full of dead bones inside, and you build tombs for the prophets your ancestors killed, and He laments over Jerusalem who kills the prophets.",
  "Matthew 24": "As Jesus leaves the temple, disciples point out the magnificent buildings, but He prophesies not one stone will be left on another. On the Mount of Olives, He describes the signs before His return: false messiahs will appear, wars and rumors of wars, famines and earthquakes, persecution of believers, the gospel preached to all nations, the abomination of desolation, great tribulation, false prophets, and cosmic signs. The Son of Man will come on clouds with power and glory, gathering His elect, but no one knows the day or hour, so watch and be ready like a faithful servant, for the Son of Man will come at an unexpected hour.",
  "Matthew 25": "Jesus tells three parables about His return: the ten virgins where five wise ones have oil for their lamps but five foolish ones don't and miss the bridegroom's arrival; the talents where servants are given different amounts and two invest wisely but one buries it in fear; and the sheep and goats where the King separates people based on whether they fed the hungry, gave drink to the thirsty, welcomed strangers, clothed the naked, and visited the sick and imprisoned, declaring 'Whatever you did for the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me,' and the righteous go to eternal life but the cursed to eternal punishment.",
  "Matthew 26": "Jesus tells disciples the Passover is in two days and He will be crucified, and the chief priests plot to arrest Him. Mary of Bethany anoints Jesus with expensive perfume, and when disciples object, He defends her, saying she has prepared Him for burial. Judas agrees to betray Jesus for thirty pieces of silver, and at the Last Supper, Jesus institutes communion, saying the bread is His body and the wine is His blood of the covenant poured out for forgiveness of sins. In Gethsemane, He prays three times 'My Father, if it is possible, take this cup from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will,' then Judas betrays Him with a kiss, He is arrested, Peter denies Him three times, and the Sanhedrin condemns Him to death.",
  "Matthew 27": "The religious leaders bind Jesus and hand Him over to Pilate, and when Judas sees Jesus condemned, he returns the thirty pieces of silver, says 'I have sinned by betraying innocent blood,' and hangs himself. Pilate questions Jesus, offers to release Him during Passover, but the crowd demands Barabbas and shouts 'Crucify him!' so Pilate washes his hands and releases Jesus to be crucified. Soldiers mock Jesus, put a crown of thorns on His head, then crucify Him at Golgotha between two criminals, and darkness covers the land from noon to 3 PM when Jesus cries out 'My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?' breathes His last, and the temple curtain tears in two from top to bottom, and Joseph of Arimathea buries Him in his own new tomb.",
  "Matthew 28": "After the Sabbath, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary go to the tomb, and an angel rolls back the stone, appearing like lightning in white as snow, telling them Jesus has risen. As they hurry to tell the disciples, Jesus meets them saying 'Greetings,' and they worship Him. The guards are bribed to say the disciples stole the body while they slept, and Jesus appears to the eleven disciples in Galilee, giving the Great Commission: 'All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.'",
  "Mark 1": "Mark begins 'The beginning of the good news about Jesus the Messiah, the Son of God,' introducing John the Baptist who baptizes with water and proclaims one coming after him who will baptize with the Holy Spirit. Jesus is baptized, the Spirit descends like a dove, and the Father declares 'You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased,' then the Spirit drives Jesus into the wilderness where He is tempted by Satan forty days. After John is arrested, Jesus proclaims 'The time has come. The kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe the good news!' He calls His first disciples, casts out an impure spirit in the synagogue, heals Peter's mother-in-law and many others, and prays alone in a solitary place early in the morning.",
  "Mark 2": "Jesus heals a paralyzed man lowered through the roof, first forgiving his sins and demonstrating the Son of Man's authority to forgive sins on earth. He calls Levi the tax collector to follow Him and eats with tax collectors and sinners, saying 'It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.' When questioned about fasting, He explains that wedding guests don't fast while the bridegroom is with them, and teaches about new wine requiring new wineskins. The Pharisees accuse His disciples of breaking the Sabbath, and Jesus declares 'The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath. So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.'",
  "Mark 3": "Jesus heals a man with a shriveled hand on the Sabbath, and the Pharisees begin plotting with the Herodians to kill Him. Great crowds follow as He heals many and casts out demons who recognize Him as the Son of God, then He appoints twelve apostles to be with Him and to preach and have authority to drive out demons. When teachers of the law accuse Him of being possessed by Beelzebul, Jesus explains that a kingdom divided against itself cannot stand, warns that blasphemy against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven, and declares that whoever does God's will is His brother, sister, and mother.",
  "Mark 4": "Jesus teaches in parables by the lake: the parable of the sower with seed falling on different soils representing different responses to God's word—the path where Satan takes it away, rocky places with no root, thorns that choke it, and good soil producing a crop. He explains that parables reveal mysteries of the kingdom to those who have ears to hear, teaches about the growing seed and mustard seed showing the kingdom's growth, and when a furious squall comes up on the lake, He calms it with 'Quiet! Be still!' and the disciples ask in awe 'Who is this? Even the wind and waves obey him!'",
  "Mark 5": "Jesus casts a legion of demons out of a man living among the tombs, sending them into a herd of pigs that rush down the steep bank into the lake, and the healed man begs to go with Jesus but is told to go home and tell what the Lord has done for him. Jairus, a synagogue leader, begs Jesus to heal his dying daughter, and on the way, a woman who had been bleeding for twelve years touches Jesus' cloak and is instantly healed. When word comes that Jairus's daughter has died, Jesus says 'Don't be afraid; just believe,' goes to the house, and takes her hand saying 'Talitha koum!' (Little girl, get up!), and she rises immediately.",
  "Mark 6": "Jesus teaches in His hometown synagogue where people take offense, and He says 'A prophet is not without honor except in his own town, among his relatives and in his own home,' and He could not do many miracles there because of their lack of faith. He sends out the twelve in pairs with authority over impure spirits, and they drive out demons and heal many. Herod has John the Baptist beheaded after Herodias's daughter requests his head, and Jesus feeds five thousand with five loaves and two fish, then walks on water to the disciples' boat, and wherever He goes, people bring the sick to touch even the edge of His cloak and are healed.",
  "Mark 7": "Pharisees and teachers of the law criticize Jesus' disciples for eating with ceremonially unclean hands, and Jesus exposes their hypocrisy—they set aside God's commands to hold to human traditions. He teaches that nothing outside a person defiles them, but what comes from within—evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, greed, malice, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander, arrogance, and folly. A Syrophoenician woman begs Jesus to drive a demon out of her daughter, and when she responds to His test with remarkable faith ('even the dogs eat the children's crumbs'), He heals her daughter, then He heals a deaf man by putting His fingers in his ears and touching his tongue, saying 'Ephphatha!' (Be opened!).",
  "Mark 8": "Jesus feeds four thousand people with seven loaves and a few small fish, then the Pharisees demand a sign and He sighs deeply, warning disciples about the yeast of the Pharisees and Herod. He heals a blind man at Bethsaida in two stages, then asks disciples who people say He is—Peter declares 'You are the Messiah'—and Jesus predicts His death and resurrection for the first time. When Peter rebukes Him, Jesus says 'Get behind me, Satan!' and teaches that whoever wants to follow Him must deny themselves and take up their cross, for whoever loses their life for Him and the gospel will save it, and what good is it to gain the whole world yet forfeit your soul?",
  "Mark 9": "Jesus takes Peter, James, and John up a high mountain where He is transfigured before them—His clothes become dazzling white—and Elijah and Moses appear. A voice from the cloud says 'This is my Son, whom I love. Listen to him!' Coming down, Jesus heals a demon-possessed boy whom the disciples couldn't help, saying 'Everything is possible for one who believes,' and the father cries out 'I do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!' Jesus again predicts His death and resurrection, teaches that whoever wants to be first must be servant of all, welcomes a child in His name, warns about causing little ones to stumble, and teaches that everyone will be salted with fire and to have salt among yourselves and be at peace.",
  "Mark 10": "Pharisees test Jesus about divorce, and He teaches that Moses permitted it because of hard hearts, but from the beginning God made them male and female to become one flesh, so what God has joined together let no one separate. He blesses little children and says the kingdom of God belongs to such as these, tells the rich young ruler to sell all and follow Him (he goes away sad), teaches it's easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for the rich to enter heaven, and promises rewards to those who have left everything to follow Him. James and John request places of honor, and Jesus teaches that whoever wants to be great must be a servant, for even the Son of Man came to serve and give His life as a ransom for many, then He heals blind Bartimaeus near Jericho.",
  "Mark 11": "Jesus enters Jerusalem on a colt, people spread cloaks and branches shouting 'Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David!' He enters the temple courts looking around at everything, then curses a fig tree the next morning. He cleanses the temple, overturning money changers' tables and saying 'My house will be called a house of prayer for all nations, but you have made it a den of robbers.' The disciples see the fig tree withered from the roots, and Jesus teaches about faith, prayer, and forgiveness—if you believe, you will receive whatever you ask in prayer, and when you stand praying, forgive so your Father in heaven may forgive you.",
  "Mark 12": "Jesus tells the parable of the tenants who kill the vineyard owner's servants and finally his son, declaring the stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone. Religious leaders try to trap Him with questions about paying taxes to Caesar ('Give back to Caesar what is Caesar's and to God what is God's'), resurrection and marriage (God is the God of the living), and the greatest commandment—Jesus answers: 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind and strength' and 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' He warns about teachers of the law who devour widows' houses, and praises a poor widow who puts two small coins in the temple treasury, saying she put in more than all the others because she gave all she had to live on.",
  "Mark 13": "As Jesus leaves the temple, disciples marvel at the magnificent buildings, but He prophesies not one stone will be left on another. He describes signs before His return: false messiahs, wars, earthquakes, famines, persecution of believers, the abomination of desolation, great distress, false prophets performing signs and wonders, cosmic disturbances, and the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory to gather His elect. He teaches the lesson of the fig tree—when its twigs get tender you know summer is near—so when you see these things happening, know it is near. Heaven and earth will pass away but His words will never pass away, yet no one knows the day or hour, so keep watch, be alert, and pray.",
  "Mark 14": "Chief priests and teachers of the law plot to arrest Jesus, and a woman anoints Him with expensive perfume, which He says prepares His body for burial. Judas agrees to betray Jesus for money, and at the Last Supper, Jesus institutes communion, saying the bread is His body and the wine is His blood of the covenant poured out for many. He predicts Peter will deny Him three times before the rooster crows twice, then in Gethsemane prays 'Abba, Father, everything is possible for you. Take this cup from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will.' Judas betrays Him with a kiss, He is arrested, Peter denies Him three times, and the Sanhedrin condemns Him to death when He affirms He is the Messiah, the Son of the Blessed One.",
  "Mark 15": "The chief priests bind Jesus and hand Him over to Pilate, who asks if He is the king of the Jews. Pilate wants to release Jesus, but the crowd demands Barabbas and shouts 'Crucify him!' so Pilate hands Him over to be crucified. Soldiers mock Jesus, put a purple robe and crown of thorns on Him, then lead Him to Golgotha and crucify Him with two rebels. At noon, darkness covers the land for three hours, and at 3 PM Jesus cries out 'Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?' (My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?), breathes His last, and the temple curtain tears in two from top to bottom. The centurion declares 'Surely this man was the Son of God!' and Joseph of Arimathea buries Jesus in a tomb cut out of rock.",
  "Mark 16": "After the Sabbath, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome go to the tomb with spices, but find the stone rolled away and a young man in a white robe who says 'He has risen! He is not here. Go, tell his disciples and Peter he is going ahead of you into Galilee.' Jesus appears first to Mary Magdalene who tells the disciples, then to two walking in the country, and finally to the eleven as they are eating, rebuking their lack of faith. He commissions them: 'Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation. Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved,' then He is taken up into heaven and sits at the right hand of God.",
  "Luke 1": "Luke writes an orderly account to Theophilus, beginning with Zechariah the priest who is struck mute when he doesn't believe the angel's announcement that his elderly wife Elizabeth will bear a son named John. The angel Gabriel appears to Mary in Nazareth, announcing she will conceive by the Holy Spirit and bear a son to be called Jesus who will reign on David's throne forever, and Mary responds 'I am the Lord's servant. May your word to me be fulfilled.' Mary visits Elizabeth, who is filled with the Spirit and proclaims 'Blessed are you among women,' and Mary praises God in the Magnificat. When John is born, Zechariah's tongue is loosed and he prophesies the Benedictus about God's salvation.",
  "Luke 2": "Caesar Augustus issues a decree for a census, and Joseph goes from Nazareth to Bethlehem with Mary, who gives birth to Jesus and lays Him in a manger because there is no guest room. Angels appear to shepherds announcing 'Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is the Messiah, the Lord,' and the shepherds find the baby and spread the word. After eight days Jesus is circumcised, and at the temple Simeon holds Jesus, declares he can die in peace having seen God's salvation, and prophesies to Mary that a sword will pierce her own soul. At twelve, Jesus stays behind in Jerusalem, and His parents find Him in the temple courts sitting among the teachers, listening and asking questions, and He grows in wisdom and stature and in favor with God and man.",
  "Luke 3": "In the fifteenth year of Tiberius Caesar, the word of God comes to John son of Zechariah in the wilderness, and he proclaims a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins, preparing the way for the Lord. John tells crowds to share with those in need, tells tax collectors to collect no more than required, tells soldiers not to extort money or accuse falsely, and warns against trusting in Abraham as father, for God can raise up children for Abraham from stones. Jesus is baptized, the Holy Spirit descends on Him in bodily form like a dove, and a voice from heaven says 'You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased,' and Luke traces Jesus' genealogy back through David and Abraham all the way to Adam, the son of God.",
  "Luke 4": "Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, is led into the wilderness where He is tempted by the devil forty days—to turn stones to bread, to worship Satan for authority over kingdoms, and to throw Himself from the temple—but Jesus resists each with Scripture. He returns to Galilee in the power of the Spirit and reads from Isaiah in the Nazareth synagogue: 'The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor,' declaring 'Today this scripture is fulfilled in your hearing.' When people take offense, He says a prophet is not accepted in his hometown, and they try to throw Him off a cliff, but He walks through the crowd and goes on His way, then casts out demons and heals many, including Peter's mother-in-law.",
  "Luke 5": "Jesus teaches from Simon's boat, then tells him to put out into deep water and let down nets, resulting in such a large catch the nets begin to break and boats nearly sink, and Simon Peter falls at Jesus' knees saying 'Go away from me, Lord; I am a sinful man!' Jesus says 'Don't be afraid; from now on you will fish for people,' and they leave everything to follow Him. Jesus heals a man with leprosy with a touch, then heals a paralyzed man lowered through the roof after forgiving his sins, demonstrating the Son of Man's authority to forgive sins on earth. He calls Levi the tax collector to follow Him, eats with tax collectors and sinners, and teaches that He came to call sinners to repentance, not the righteous, and that new wine must be poured into new wineskins.",
  "Luke 6": "On the Sabbath, Jesus' disciples pick grain and eat it, and Pharisees object, but Jesus declares the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath. He heals a man with a shriveled hand on the Sabbath, and the Pharisees are furious, then He chooses twelve apostles after praying all night. He delivers the Sermon on the Plain with beatitudes and woes: blessed are the poor, hungry, weeping, and persecuted, but woe to the rich, well-fed, laughing, and popular. He teaches to love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, turn the other cheek, give to everyone who asks, treat others as you want to be treated, be merciful as your Father is merciful, don't judge, forgive, give generously, and a tree is recognized by its fruit—why do you call Me 'Lord, Lord' but not do what I say?",
  "Luke 7": "Jesus heals a centurion's servant without going to the house, marveling at the centurion's faith—'I have not found such great faith even in Israel.' At Nain, He raises a widow's son from the dead, touching the coffin and saying 'Young man, I say to you, get up!' When John the Baptist's disciples ask if Jesus is the Messiah, Jesus points to His miracles and praises John as the greatest born of women. A sinful woman anoints Jesus' feet with perfume and tears at a Pharisee's house, and Jesus tells a parable about two debtors—the one forgiven more loves more—and declares to the woman 'Your sins are forgiven... Your faith has saved you; go in peace.'",
  "Luke 8": "Jesus travels proclaiming the good news of the kingdom with the Twelve and women who support them out of their means, including Mary Magdalene, Joanna, and Susanna. He teaches the parable of the sower and explains that seed on good soil represents those who hear the word, retain it, and produce a crop, and that nothing is hidden that won't be disclosed. He calms a storm on the lake, casts a legion of demons out of a man into pigs, heals a woman who touched His cloak after bleeding twelve years, and raises Jairus's daughter from death saying 'My child, get up!'",
  "Luke 9": "Jesus sends out the Twelve with power and authority to drive out demons and cure diseases, proclaiming the kingdom of God. Herod is perplexed about Jesus, having beheaded John, asking 'Who is this I hear such things about?' Jesus feeds five thousand with five loaves and two fish, then asks disciples who they say He is—Peter answers 'God's Messiah'—and Jesus predicts His death and resurrection, teaching that whoever wants to follow Him must deny themselves and take up their cross daily. He is transfigured on a mountain before Peter, James, and John, appearing in glorious splendor with Moses and Elijah, and the Father's voice declares 'This is my Son, whom I have chosen; listen to him!' He heals a demon-possessed boy, again predicts His betrayal, teaches that whoever is least is greatest, and resolutely sets out for Jerusalem.",
  "Luke 10": "Jesus sends out seventy-two disciples in pairs to every town He is about to visit, saying the harvest is plentiful but workers are few, and they return with joy reporting even demons submit to them in His name. Jesus rejoices in the Holy Spirit and says no one knows who the Son is except the Father, or who the Father is except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal Him. When a legal expert asks what he must do to inherit eternal life, Jesus tells the parable of the Good Samaritan—a Samaritan helps a beaten man after a priest and Levite pass by—showing that loving your neighbor means showing mercy. At Martha and Mary's home, Martha is distracted with preparations while Mary sits at Jesus' feet listening, and Jesus says 'Mary has chosen what is better.'",
  "Luke 11": "Jesus teaches the disciples to pray the Lord's Prayer, then tells a parable about a persistent friend asking for bread at midnight, teaching to ask and it will be given, seek and you will find, knock and the door will be opened. When accused of driving out demons by Beelzebul, He warns that a kingdom divided against itself falls, and when an impure spirit leaves a person, it returns with seven other spirits if the house remains empty. He pronounces woes on Pharisees and experts in the law for their hypocrisy—they love important seats, load people with burdens, neglect justice and God's love, and are like unmarked graves that people walk over without knowing it.",
  "Luke 12": "Jesus warns His disciples to beware of the yeast of the Pharisees—hypocrisy—for everything concealed will be disclosed. Don't be afraid of those who kill the body, but fear God who has authority to throw into hell, yet not one sparrow is forgotten by God and the hairs on your head are numbered. When the Holy Spirit comes on you, He will teach you what to say, so don't worry about what to eat, drink, or wear—life is more than food and body more than clothes—but seek His kingdom and these things will be given. Be ready, for the Son of Man will come at an unexpected hour like a thief in the night, and from everyone given much, much will be demanded.",
  "Luke 13": "Jesus warns that unless you repent, you will all perish, and tells a parable about a fig tree given one more year to bear fruit. He heals a crippled woman on the Sabbath, and when the synagogue leader objects, Jesus exposes the hypocrisy—don't you untie your ox on the Sabbath to give it water? He teaches parables about the kingdom—it's like a mustard seed that grows large, like yeast that works through dough—and warns to make every effort to enter through the narrow door, for many will try and not be able, and He will say 'I don't know you or where you come from. Away from me, all you evildoers!' He laments over Jerusalem who kills the prophets and stones those sent to her.",
  "Luke 14": "At a Pharisee's house, Jesus heals a man with abnormal swelling on the Sabbath, asking whether it's lawful to heal on the Sabbath or not, and they remain silent. He teaches about humility—don't take the place of honor at a banquet but take the lowest place—and when you give a banquet, invite the poor, crippled, lame, and blind who cannot repay you. He tells the parable of the great banquet where invited guests make excuses, so the master sends servants to bring in the poor, crippled, blind, and lame from the streets. He teaches about counting the cost of discipleship—anyone who doesn't carry their cross and follow Him cannot be His disciple—and warns that salt that loses saltiness is thrown out.",
  "Luke 15": "When tax collectors and sinners gather to hear Jesus, the Pharisees mutter 'This man welcomes sinners and eats with them,' so Jesus tells three parables about the lost: a shepherd leaves ninety-nine sheep to find one that is lost and rejoices when he finds it; a woman searches diligently for one lost coin and celebrates when she finds it; and a father welcomes home his prodigal son who squandered his inheritance but returned repentant, while the older brother is angry and refuses to join the celebration. In each, there is great rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents.",
  "Luke 16": "Jesus tells the parable of the shrewd manager who reduces debts to prepare for his future, teaching to use worldly wealth to gain friends so when it's gone you'll be welcomed into eternal dwellings, and whoever is faithful with little will be faithful with much. The Pharisees, who love money, sneer at Him, and He warns that what people value highly is detestable in God's sight. He teaches that the Law and Prophets point to the kingdom, and it's easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of the Law to drop out. He tells the parable of the rich man and Lazarus—the rich man feasts daily while Lazarus begs at his gate, and when both die, Lazarus is carried to Abraham's side but the rich man is in torment, and Abraham says if they don't listen to Moses and the Prophets, they won't be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.",
  "Luke 17": "Jesus teaches about sin, repentance, and faith: if your brother sins, rebuke him, and if he repents, forgive him, even if he sins against you seven times in a day and returns repenting. If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you could say to this mulberry tree 'Be uprooted and planted in the sea' and it will obey. He heals ten men with leprosy, but only one—a Samaritan—returns to give thanks and praise God, and Jesus says 'Your faith has made you well.' He teaches that the kingdom of God is in your midst, and describes His return—people will be eating, drinking, buying, selling, planting, building, just like in Noah's and Lot's day—so remember Lot's wife and don't look back, for whoever tries to keep their life will lose it.",
  "Luke 18": "Jesus tells a parable about a persistent widow and an unjust judge to show that disciples should always pray and not give up, for if an unjust judge gives justice, how much more will God grant justice to His chosen ones who cry out day and night! He tells the parable of the Pharisee and tax collector praying—the Pharisee boasts of his righteousness, but the tax collector beats his breast saying 'God, have mercy on me, a sinner'—and Jesus declares the tax collector went home justified, for all who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted. He blesses little children, tells a rich ruler to sell all and follow Him, teaches it's easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for the rich to enter heaven, predicts His death and resurrection, and heals a blind beggar near Jericho.",
  "Luke 19": "In Jericho, Zacchaeus the chief tax collector climbs a sycamore tree to see Jesus, who looks up and says 'Come down immediately. I must stay at your house today,' and Zacchaeus receives Him joyfully and pledges to give half his possessions to the poor and pay back four times anything he cheated. Jesus declares 'Today salvation has come to this house... For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.' He tells the parable of ten minas given to servants to invest during the master's absence, then enters Jerusalem on a colt while crowds spread cloaks and shout 'Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord!' He weeps over Jerusalem, knowing the days will come when enemies will encircle and destroy her because she didn't recognize the time of God's coming, then He cleanses the temple.",
  "Luke 20": "Religious leaders question Jesus' authority, and He asks them about John's baptism—was it from heaven or from human origin? When they won't answer, He won't tell them by what authority He acts. He tells the parable of the tenants who beat the owner's servants and kill his son, declaring the stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone. Teachers of the law try to trap Him with questions about paying taxes to Caesar ('Give back to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's'), and Sadducees question Him about resurrection and marriage (those worthy to attain the resurrection neither marry nor can die, for they are like angels), then He asks them how David calls the Messiah 'Lord' if He is David's son, and warns against teachers of the law who devour widows' houses.",
  "Luke 21": "Jesus watches the rich putting gifts into the temple treasury, then sees a poor widow put in two small copper coins and declares she has put in more than all the others, for they gave out of their wealth but she out of her poverty gave all she had to live on. When disciples marvel at the temple's magnificent stones, He prophesies not one will be left on another. He describes signs before His return: false messiahs, wars, earthquakes, famines, persecutions, betrayals by family and friends, Jerusalem surrounded by armies, great distress, cosmic disturbances, and the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. He teaches the parable of the fig tree—when it sprouts leaves you know summer is near—so when these things happen, know the kingdom of God is near.",
  "Luke 22": "The Festival of Unleavened Bread approaches, chief priests seek a way to kill Jesus, and Satan enters Judas who agrees to betray Him. At the Last Supper, Jesus institutes communion saying the bread is His body given for them and the cup is the new covenant in His blood poured out for them, and He predicts Peter will deny Him three times before the rooster crows. In great anguish on the Mount of Olives, He prays 'Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; yet not my will, but yours be done,' and an angel strengthens Him as His sweat becomes like drops of blood. Judas betrays Him with a kiss, He heals the high priest's servant's ear, Peter denies Him three times, and the council condemns Him, mocking and beating Him and demanding 'If you are the Messiah, tell us.'",
  "Luke 23": "The assembly brings Jesus to Pilate, accusing Him of subverting the nation, opposing payment of taxes to Caesar, and claiming to be Messiah, a king. Pilate finds no basis for charges and sends Him to Herod who questions Him at length, but Jesus gives no answer, so Herod's soldiers mock Him and send Him back. Pilate declares he will punish and release Jesus, but the crowd shouts 'Crucify him! Crucify him!' demanding Barabbas instead. At Golgotha they crucify Jesus between two criminals, and Jesus says 'Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.' One criminal mocks Him, but the other asks to be remembered, and Jesus promises 'Today you will be with me in paradise.' At noon darkness covers the land until 3 PM when Jesus calls out 'Father, into your hands I commit my spirit' and breathes His last, the temple curtain tears in two, and the centurion praises God saying 'Surely this was a righteous man.'",
  "Luke 24": "On the first day of the week, women go to the tomb with spices but find the stone rolled away and the body gone, and two men in gleaming clothes ask 'Why do you look for the living among the dead? He is not here; he has risen!' On the road to Emmaus, Jesus walks with two disciples explaining how the Messiah had to suffer these things according to the Scriptures, and when He breaks bread with them their eyes are opened and they recognize Him, then He vanishes. He appears to the disciples in Jerusalem, shows them His hands and feet, eats fish, opens their minds to understand the Scriptures, and commissions them to preach repentance for the forgiveness of sins to all nations beginning in Jerusalem. He leads them to Bethany, blesses them, and is taken up into heaven, and they return to Jerusalem with great joy, continually praising God in the temple.",
  "John 1": "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God—through Him all things were made, and in Him was life, the light of all mankind. John the Baptist testifies he is not the Messiah but came to prepare the way, and when he sees Jesus, he declares 'Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!' and 'I have seen and testify that this is God's Chosen One.' Andrew follows Jesus and brings his brother Simon (whom Jesus calls Peter), then Philip finds Nathanael and brings him to Jesus who says 'Here truly is an Israelite in whom there is no deceit,' and when Nathanael asks how Jesus knows him, Jesus says He saw him under the fig tree, and Nathanael declares 'Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the king of Israel.'",
  "John 2": "At a wedding in Cana, Jesus turns water into wine in His first sign, revealing His glory, and His disciples believe in Him. He goes to Jerusalem for Passover, makes a whip of cords, and drives out those selling cattle, sheep, and doves from the temple courts, overturning money changers' tables and declaring 'Stop turning my Father's house into a market!' When Jews demand a sign, He says 'Destroy this temple, and I will raise it again in three days,' speaking of His body. Many believe in His name when they see His signs, but Jesus doesn't entrust Himself to them because He knows what is in each person.",
  "John 3": "Nicodemus, a Pharisee, comes to Jesus at night, and Jesus tells him 'Very truly I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God unless they are born again,' explaining that flesh gives birth to flesh but the Spirit gives birth to spirit. He declares 'Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, that everyone who believes may have eternal life in him,' and speaks the famous words: 'For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.' John the Baptist rejoices that Jesus is increasing while he decreases, testifying that whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life.",
  "John 4": "At Jacob's well in Samaria, Jesus asks a Samaritan woman for water and tells her about living water that becomes a spring welling up to eternal life. When she mentions she has no husband, Jesus reveals He knows she has had five husbands and the man she's with now is not her husband, and she recognizes Him as a prophet. He declares that true worshipers will worship the Father in Spirit and in truth, and when she mentions the Messiah, Jesus says 'I, the one speaking to you—I am he.' Many Samaritans believe because of the woman's testimony, and after staying two days, many more believe because of His words. In Galilee, Jesus heals a royal official's son from a distance, and the official and his whole household believe.",
  "John 5": "At the pool of Bethesda, Jesus heals a man who had been an invalid for thirty-eight years, telling him 'Get up! Pick up your mat and walk,' and he is instantly cured. Because Jesus does this on the Sabbath, Jewish leaders persecute Him, but Jesus says 'My Father is always at his work to this very day, and I too am working,' making Himself equal with God. He declares the Son gives life to whom He is pleased to give it, the Father has entrusted all judgment to the Son, whoever hears His word and believes has eternal life and has crossed over from death to life, and a time is coming when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God and come out—those who have done good to resurrection of life, and those who have done evil to resurrection of judgment.",
  "John 6": "Jesus feeds five thousand with a boy's five loaves and two fish, and the people want to make Him king by force, but He withdraws. He walks on water to the disciples' boat, and the next day when the crowd finds Him, He says they're looking for Him not because of signs but because they ate the loaves and had their fill—don't work for food that spoils, but for food that endures to eternal life. He declares 'I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never go hungry, and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty,' and 'I am the living bread that came down from heaven. Whoever eats this bread will live forever. This bread is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.' Many disciples turn back, and Jesus asks the Twelve if they want to leave too, but Peter responds 'Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life.'",
  "John 7": "Jesus goes to Jerusalem for the Festival of Tabernacles and teaches in the temple courts, and people are divided about Him—some believing He is the Messiah, others questioning how the Messiah could come from Galilee. Nicodemus defends Him, asking if their law condemns a man without first hearing him, but the Pharisees reply 'Are you from Galilee, too? Look into it, and you will find that a prophet does not come out of Galilee.' On the last and greatest day of the festival, Jesus stands and cries out 'Let anyone who is thirsty come to me and drink. Whoever believes in me, as Scripture has said, rivers of living water will flow from within them,' speaking about the Spirit.",
  "John 8": "Teachers of the law bring a woman caught in adultery, testing Jesus about whether to stone her, but He bends down and writes on the ground, then says 'Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her,' and one by one they leave, and He tells her 'Neither do I condemn you. Go now and leave your life of sin.' Jesus declares 'I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life,' and 'Before Abraham was born, I am!' causing the Jews to pick up stones to stone Him for blasphemy, but He hides and slips away from the temple grounds.",
  "John 9": "Jesus sees a man blind from birth, spits on the ground, makes mud, puts it on the man's eyes, and tells him to wash in the Pool of Siloam—he goes, washes, and comes home seeing. Pharisees investigate, questioning the man and his parents, and they throw him out when he defends Jesus, asking 'Do you want to become his disciples too?' Jesus finds him and asks 'Do you believe in the Son of Man?' and when the man asks who He is, Jesus says 'You have now seen him; in fact, he is the one speaking with you,' and the man worships Him. Jesus declares He came into this world for judgment so the blind will see and those who see will become blind.",
  "John 10": "Jesus declares 'I am the gate for the sheep'—whoever enters through Him will be saved, will come in and go out and find pasture, for the thief comes to steal, kill, and destroy, but He came that they may have life and have it abundantly. He says 'I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep,' and 'I have other sheep that are not of this sheep pen. I must bring them also. They too will listen to my voice, and there shall be one flock and one shepherd.' At the Festival of Dedication, Jews surround Him demanding He tell them plainly if He is the Messiah, and He says 'I and the Father are one,' and they pick up stones to stone Him for blasphemy, but He escapes their grasp.",
  "John 11": "When Jesus hears Lazarus is sick, He stays where He is two more days, then goes to Bethany where Lazarus has been dead four days. Martha comes to meet Him saying 'Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died,' and Jesus declares 'I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die; and whoever lives by believing in me will never die. Do you believe this?' She responds 'Yes, Lord, I believe that you are the Messiah, the Son of God.' At the tomb, Jesus prays, then calls 'Lazarus, come out!' and the dead man comes out wrapped in grave clothes, and many Jews believe in Him, but the chief priests and Pharisees plot to kill Him.",
  "John 12": "Six days before Passover, Mary anoints Jesus' feet with expensive perfume and wipes them with her hair, and when Judas objects, Jesus says 'Leave her alone. It was intended that she should save this perfume for the day of my burial. You will always have the poor among you, but you will not always have me.' Jesus enters Jerusalem on a young donkey, and crowds shout 'Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!' He declares the hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified—unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed, but if it dies, it produces many seeds. A voice from heaven speaks, and Jesus says 'Now is the time for judgment on this world; now the prince of this world will be driven out. And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself.'",
  "John 13": "Before the Passover Festival, Jesus knows the hour has come to leave this world and go to the Father, so He rises from the meal, wraps a towel around His waist, and washes His disciples' feet, teaching them to serve one another as He has served them. He predicts His betrayal—'Very truly I tell you, one of you is going to betray me'—and when Judas takes the bread Jesus gives him, Satan enters him, and Jesus says 'What you are about to do, do quickly,' and Judas goes out into the night. Jesus gives a new command: 'Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another,' and He predicts Peter will deny Him three times before the rooster crows.",
  "John 14": "Jesus comforts the troubled disciples: 'Do not let your hearts be troubled. You believe in God; believe also in me. My Father's house has many rooms... I am going there to prepare a place for you... I will come back and take you to be with me.' He declares 'I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me,' and 'Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father.' He promises to send the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, who will teach them all things and remind them of everything He has said, and He gives them His peace, not as the world gives—'Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid.'",
  "John 15": "Jesus teaches 'I am the true vine, and my Father is the gardener'—every branch that bears fruit He prunes to make it more fruitful, and branches that don't remain in the vine are thrown away and burned. 'Remain in me, as I also remain in you. No branch can bear fruit by itself; it must remain in the vine. Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in me. I am the vine; you are the branches.' He commands them to love each other as He has loved them—greater love has no one than this: to lay down one's life for one's friends. He warns they will be hated by the world because they are not of the world, just as the world hated Him first, and He will send the Advocate, the Spirit of truth.",
  "John 16": "Jesus warns that a time is coming when anyone who kills them will think they are offering service to God, but He tells them these things so when their time comes they will remember He warned them. It's for their good that He goes away, for unless He goes, the Advocate won't come, but when He goes, He will send the Spirit who will guide them into all truth. He speaks of a woman in labor having pain but forgetting the anguish in joy that a child is born—'So with you: Now is your time of grief, but I will see you again and you will rejoice, and no one will take away your joy.' In a little while they won't see Him, then after a little while they will, and He declares 'I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.'",
  "John 17": "Jesus looks toward heaven and prays: 'Father, the hour has come. Glorify your Son, that your Son may glorify you,' and 'Now this is eternal life: that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.' He prays for His disciples: 'I have revealed you to those whom you gave me out of the world... Sanctify them by the truth; your word is truth... As you sent me into the world, I have sent them into the world.' He prays for all believers: 'I pray also for those who will believe in me through their message, that all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you... Father, I want those you have given me to be with me where I am, and to see my glory.'",
  "John 18": "In the garden across the Kidron Valley, Judas brings soldiers and officials to arrest Jesus, and when Jesus says 'I am he,' they draw back and fall to the ground. Peter draws his sword and cuts off the high priest's servant's ear, but Jesus tells him to put it away—'Shall I not drink the cup the Father has given me?' Annas questions Jesus who refers him to His public teaching, and when an official strikes Jesus for answering that way, Jesus asks 'If I said something wrong, testify as to what is wrong. But if I spoke the truth, why did you strike me?' Meanwhile, Peter denies Jesus three times, and the rooster crows. Pilate questions Jesus who says His kingdom is not of this world, and when Pilate asks 'What is truth?' he finds no basis for charges, but the crowd demands Barabbas.",
  "John 19": "Pilate has Jesus flogged, and soldiers twist a crown of thorns, put it on His head, dress Him in a purple robe, and strike Him. Pilate brings Jesus out wearing the crown, saying 'Here is the man!' but chief priests shout 'Crucify! Crucify!' When they claim 'We have a law, and according to that law he must die, because he claimed to be the Son of God,' Pilate is even more afraid, but when they say 'If you let this man go, you are no friend of Caesar,' Pilate hands Him over. At Golgotha they crucify Jesus with two others, and above His head Pilate places a sign: JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS. From the cross, Jesus entrusts His mother to John's care, then says 'I am thirsty' and 'It is finished,' and bows His head and gives up His spirit. Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus take His body and wrap it with myrrh and aloes, laying Him in a new tomb.",
  "John 20": "Early on the first day of the week while it is still dark, Mary Magdalene finds the stone removed from the tomb and runs to tell Peter and John who run to the tomb and find the linen cloths but no body. Mary stays weeping outside, and when she looks in, two angels ask why she's crying, then Jesus appears and says 'Mary,' and she turns crying 'Rabboni!' He tells her to go tell the disciples 'I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.' That evening Jesus appears to the disciples, shows them His hands and side, breathes on them saying 'Receive the Holy Spirit,' and gives them authority to forgive sins. Thomas isn't there and says he won't believe unless he sees the nail marks, but a week later Jesus appears and tells Thomas 'Put your finger here; see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting and believe,' and Thomas declares 'My Lord and my God!'",
  "John 21": "At the Sea of Galilee, Peter and six other disciples fish all night but catch nothing, then Jesus appears on shore at dawn and tells them to throw the net on the right side—they catch 153 large fish and the net doesn't break. After eating breakfast, Jesus asks Peter three times 'Do you love me?' and each time tells him 'Feed my lambs,' 'Take care of my sheep,' 'Feed my sheep,' restoring Peter after his three denials. He predicts how Peter will die glorifying God, and when Peter asks about John's fate, Jesus says 'If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you? You must follow me.' John closes declaring there are many other things Jesus did—if every one were written down, the whole world would not have room for the books.",
  "Acts 1": "After His resurrection, Jesus appears to the apostles for forty days teaching about the kingdom of God, then commands them to wait in Jerusalem for the Holy Spirit who will empower them to be His witnesses to the ends of the earth. He is taken up into heaven, and the apostles return to Jerusalem where they pray together and choose Matthias to replace Judas among the Twelve.",
  "Acts 2": "On Pentecost, the Holy Spirit fills the believers with a rushing wind and tongues of fire, enabling them to speak in other languages so visiting Jews from every nation hear God's wonders in their own tongues. Peter preaches that Jesus, whom they crucified, has been raised and exalted by God as both Lord and Messiah, and 3,000 people believe, are baptized, and devote themselves to the apostles' teaching, fellowship, breaking of bread, and prayer.",
  "Acts 3": "Peter heals a lame beggar at the temple gate in Jesus' name, and when crowds gather amazed, Peter preaches that they killed the author of life but God raised Him from the dead. He calls them to repent and turn to God so their sins may be wiped out.",
  "Acts 4": "The priests and Sadducees arrest Peter and John, but 5,000 who heard the message believe. When questioned by the Sanhedrin, Peter boldly declares salvation is found in no one else but Jesus, and though ordered not to speak in His name, they reply they must obey God rather than men.",
  "Acts 5": "Ananias and Sapphira lie about their giving and both drop dead when exposed by Peter, striking fear in the church. The apostles perform many miracles, are arrested but freed by an angel, and when brought before the Sanhedrin again, they declare they must obey God rather than men, receiving a flogging but rejoicing they were counted worthy to suffer for the Name.",
  "Acts 6": "When Grecian widows are overlooked in daily distribution, the apostles appoint seven men including Stephen and Philip to serve tables so they can focus on prayer and the word. Stephen performs great wonders and signs, but members of the Synagogue of the Freedmen bring false charges that he speaks against Moses and the temple.",
  "Acts 7": "Stephen delivers a lengthy sermon recounting Israel's history of resisting God, from Abraham through Moses to Solomon, concluding that they are stiff-necked people who always resist the Holy Spirit just like their ancestors. As they stone him to death, he sees Jesus standing at God's right hand and prays 'Lord, do not hold this sin against them,' while Saul approves of his execution.",
  "Acts 8": "Persecution scatters believers throughout Judea and Samaria, and Philip preaches in Samaria with great signs and joy. The Spirit directs Philip to an Ethiopian eunuch reading Isaiah, Philip explains the gospel about Jesus, and the eunuch believes and is baptized.",
  "Acts 9": "On the road to Damascus to arrest believers, Saul encounters the risen Jesus in a blinding light and hears 'Saul, why do you persecute me?' Ananias restores his sight, Saul is baptized and filled with the Holy Spirit, then immediately begins preaching in synagogues that Jesus is the Son of God, astonishing everyone who knew him as a persecutor.",
  "Acts 10": "God gives Peter a vision of unclean animals with a voice saying 'Do not call anything impure that God has made clean,' preparing him to go to the Gentile Cornelius's house. While Peter preaches about Jesus, the Holy Spirit falls on all the Gentiles present, and Peter has them baptized, realizing God shows no favoritism but accepts people from every nation.",
  "Acts 11": "When criticized for eating with Gentiles, Peter explains his vision and how the Spirit came on the Gentiles just as on the apostles, silencing objections and leading believers to praise God for granting even Gentiles repentance unto life. In Antioch, many Greeks believe and turn to the Lord, Barnabas rejoices at God's grace, and he brings Saul to teach for a year—the disciples are first called Christians there.",
  "Acts 12": "Herod executes James and imprisons Peter, but an angel frees Peter from prison the night before his trial while believers are praying for him. When Peter appears at Mary's house and knocks, the servant girl Rhoda is so excited she forgets to open the door, and when Herod delivers a speech accepting worship as a god, an angel strikes him down and he dies eaten by worms.",
  "Acts 13": "The Holy Spirit sets apart Barnabas and Saul for missionary work, and they preach in synagogues that Jesus is the Messiah through whom everyone who believes receives forgiveness and justification. When Jews reject their message, Paul and Barnabas boldly turn to the Gentiles, and many believe.",
  "Acts 14": "In Lystra, Paul heals a lame man and the crowd thinks they are gods, trying to sacrifice to them, but Jews from other cities stone Paul and drag him outside the city. He gets up, returns to the city, then they continue preaching, strengthening disciples, appointing elders, and committing them to the Lord.",
  "Acts 15": "The Jerusalem Council addresses whether Gentiles must be circumcised to be saved, and Peter declares God gave the Holy Spirit to Gentiles just as to Jews, purifying their hearts by faith.

  "Acts 16": "Paul has a vision of a Macedonian man begging 'Come help us,' so they go to Philippi where Lydia believes and is baptized with her household. After Paul casts a spirit out of a slave girl, her owners have Paul and Silas beaten and imprisoned, but an earthquake opens the prison doors, and the jailer and his household believe and are baptized.",
  "Acts 17": "In Thessalonica, some believe but other Jews form a mob, so Paul goes to Berea where people examine the Scriptures daily and many believe. In Athens, Paul preaches to philosophers about the unknown God who made the world and appointed a day of judgment through the man He raised from the dead.",
  "Acts 18": "Paul stays in Corinth for eighteen months working as a tentmaker with Aquila and Priscilla and testifying that Jesus is the Messiah. When opposed by Jews, he declares he will go to the Gentiles, and many Corinthians believe and are baptized.",
  "Acts 19": "In Ephesus, Paul teaches daily in the lecture hall of Tyrannus for two years, and God does extraordinary miracles through him. When some Jewish exorcists try to use Jesus' name, a demon-possessed man attacks them, and many who practiced sorcery publicly burn their scrolls, but a riot breaks out when a silversmith claims Paul threatens their Artemis worship.",
  "Acts 20": "In Troas, Eutychus falls from a third-story window during Paul's lengthy message and dies, but Paul raises him back to life.

  "Acts 21": "Despite prophetic warnings that he will be bound and handed over to Gentiles, Paul is determined to go to Jerusalem. In the temple, Jews from Asia stir up a crowd against him, drag him out, and try to kill him, but Roman soldiers rescue him and allow him to address the crowd.",
  "Acts 22": "Paul recounts his background as a zealous Pharisee who persecuted Christians, his encounter with Jesus on the Damascus road, and how the Lord sent him to the Gentiles. When he mentions Gentiles, the crowd erupts demanding his death, and the commander orders him flogged until learning Paul is a Roman citizen.",
  "Acts 23": "Paul divides the Sanhedrin by declaring he's on trial for believing in resurrection, causing Pharisees and Sadducees to argue. The Lord appears to Paul that night saying 'Take courage! As you testified about me in Jerusalem, so you must testify in Rome,' and when Paul's nephew warns of an assassination plot, the commander sends Paul under heavy guard to Governor Felix.",
  "Acts 24": "Jewish leaders present charges before Felix, accusing Paul of being a troublemaker and sect leader who tried to desecrate the temple. Paul defends himself as a follower of the Way who believes in the resurrection of both righteous and wicked, and Felix keeps him in custody for two years.",
  "Acts 25": "When the new governor Festus asks Paul to stand trial in Jerusalem, Paul appeals to Caesar, saying he has done nothing wrong to the Jews. King Agrippa arrives and expresses interest in hearing Paul's case.",
  "Acts 26": "Paul recounts his conversion before King Agrippa, explaining how Jesus commissioned him to open Gentiles' eyes so they may turn from darkness to light and from Satan to God. When Festus says Paul's learning is driving him insane, Paul insists he speaks truth, and Agrippa says 'Do you think you can persuade me to be a Christian in such a short time?'",
  "Acts 27": "Sailing to Rome, Paul's ship encounters a violent storm called the Northeaster, and after days without seeing sun or stars, all hope seems lost. An angel assures Paul that he must stand before Caesar and God will spare all 276 people on board, and they run aground on Malta where everyone reaches land safely.",
  "Acts 28": "On Malta, a viper bites Paul but he suffers no harm, and he heals many including the chief official's father. After three months they sail to Rome where Paul is allowed to live under house arrest, preaching the kingdom of God and teaching about Jesus boldly and without hindrance for two years.",
  "Romans 1": "Paul declares he is not ashamed of the gospel because it is God's power bringing salvation to everyone who believes, revealing a righteousness by faith from first to last. He describes how people suppressed the truth about God evident in creation, exchanged His glory for idols, and were given over to shameful lusts and depraved minds filled with every kind of wickedness.",
  "Romans 2": "Paul warns that when you judge others while doing the same things, you condemn yourself and will not escape God's judgment, for He will repay each person according to what they have done. True circumcision is not merely outward and physical but circumcision of the heart by the Spirit, and a true Jew is one inwardly.",
  "Romans 3": "All are under sin—there is no one righteous, not even one—and no one will be declared righteous by observing the law. But now God's righteousness has been revealed through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe, for all have sinned and fall short of God's glory, yet are justified freely by His grace through the redemption in Christ Jesus.",
  "Romans 4": "Abraham believed God and it was credited to him as righteousness—not by works but by faith—and this was before he was circumcised, making him the father of all who believe. The words 'it was credited to him' were written not only for Abraham but also for us who believe in Him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead.",
  "Romans 5": "Since we are justified by faith, we have peace with God through Jesus Christ and rejoice in hope of God's glory, and even in suffering which produces perseverance, character, and hope. God demonstrates His love in this: while we were still sinners, Christ died for us, and just as one trespass brought condemnation to all, one righteous act brought justification and life to all.",
  "Romans 6": "Shall we go on sinning so grace may increase? By no means! We died to sin—how can we live in it any longer? We were buried with Christ through baptism into death so we too may live a new life, and we must count ourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus.",
  "Romans 7": "The law has authority over someone only as long as they live, and we have been released from the law by dying to what once bound us so we serve in the new way of the Spirit. The law is holy and good, but sin used it to produce death in me, and what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do—what a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death? Thanks be to God, who delivers me through Jesus Christ our Lord.",
  "Romans 8": "There is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus, because through Him the Spirit of life has set you free from the law of sin and death. The Spirit testifies with our spirit that we are God's children, heirs with Christ who share in His sufferings and glory, and in all things God works for the good of those who love Him, and if God is for us, who can be against us? Neither death nor life, angels nor demons, present nor future, height nor depth, nor anything in all creation can separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.",
  "Romans 9": "Paul has great sorrow for his fellow Israelites who have the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the law, and the promises, yet not all Israel are truly Israel. God has mercy on whom He wants to have mercy, and whom He wants to harden, He hardens, for He says to Pharaoh 'I raised you up for this very purpose, that I might display my power in you.'",
  "Romans 10": "Israel pursued righteousness by works rather than by faith, stumbling over the stumbling stone, but Christ is the culmination of the law so that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes. If you declare with your mouth 'Jesus is Lord' and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved, for everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved, and how can they call on Him without believing, or believe without hearing, or hear without someone preaching?",
  "Romans 11": "God did not reject His people Israel, for there is always a remnant chosen by grace, and Israel's transgression means salvation for the Gentiles to make Israel envious. Do not be arrogant toward the branches that were broken off, for if God did not spare the natural branches, He will not spare you either, and oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God—how unsearchable His judgments and unfathomable His ways!",
  "Romans 12": "Offer your bodies as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God, and be transformed by the renewing of your mind. We have different gifts according to the grace given—prophecy, serving, teaching, encouraging, giving, leading, showing mercy—so use them faithfully. Love must be sincere, hate what is evil, be devoted to one another, never be lacking in zeal, be joyful in hope, patient in affliction, bless those who persecute you, live in harmony, and do not be overcome by evil but overcome evil with good.",
  "Romans 13": "Everyone must submit to governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established, and the authorities are God's servants for your good. Love fulfills the law, for love does no harm to a neighbor, and the hour has already come for you to wake from slumber—the night is nearly over and the day is almost here, so clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ.",
  "Romans 14": "Accept the one whose faith is weak without quarreling over disputable matters, for one person's faith allows them to eat anything while another eats only vegetables. Each one should be fully convinced in their own mind, for we will all stand before God's judgment seat, so stop passing judgment on one another and make up your mind not to put any stumbling block in the way of a brother or sister.",
  "Romans 15": "We who are strong ought to bear with the failings of the weak and not please ourselves, for even Christ did not please Himself. Paul explains his ministry as a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles, priestly duty of proclaiming the gospel so the Gentiles might become an offering acceptable to God, and he plans to visit Rome on his way to Spain after delivering a contribution to the poor in Jerusalem.",
  "Romans 16": "Paul commends Phoebe, a deaconess, and sends greetings to many believers including Priscilla and Aquila, Mary, Andronicus and Junia, and others who have worked hard in the Lord. He warns about those who cause divisions contrary to the teaching and urges them to be wise about what is good and innocent about what is evil, then closes with a doxology praising God who is able to strengthen them according to the gospel and the mystery now revealed through the prophetic writings.",
  "1 Corinthians 1": "Paul addresses the church in Corinth, thanking God for the grace given them in Christ Jesus, but appeals to them to agree with one another and not be divided, for some say 'I follow Paul,' others 'I follow Apollos' or 'I follow Cephas' or 'I follow Christ.' He declares he was sent not to baptize but to preach the gospel—not with wisdom and eloquence lest the cross be emptied of its power—for the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing but the power of God to those being saved.",
  "1 Corinthians 2": "Paul came to Corinth in weakness and fear, resolving to know nothing except Jesus Christ and Him crucified, so their faith might not rest on human wisdom but on God's power. We speak God's wisdom, a mystery hidden but revealed to us by the Spirit, for 'What no eye has seen, what no ear has heard, what no human mind has conceived'—these things God has prepared for those who love Him, and the person without the Spirit does not accept the things of the Spirit for they are foolishness to them.",
  "1 Corinthians 3": "Paul could not address them as people of the Spirit but as worldly—mere infants in Christ—for they are still acting like mere humans with jealousy and quarreling. He and Apollos are merely servants through whom they believed—Paul planted, Apollos watered, but God made it grow, and they are God's field and building, so let each one be careful how they build on the foundation of Jesus Christ.",
  "1 Corinthians 4": "People ought to regard apostles as servants of Christ and stewards of God's mysteries, faithful in their trust, and Paul cares very little if he is judged by them or any human court. The apostles have become a spectacle—fools for Christ, weak, dishonored, hungry, thirsty, brutally treated, and homeless—yet when cursed, they bless, when persecuted, they endure, and he appeals to them to imitate him as their father in Christ Jesus.",
  "1 Corinthians 5": "Paul rebukes the church for tolerating sexual immorality—a man has his father's wife—that doesn't even occur among pagans, and they should hand this man over to Satan so his spirit may be saved. He instructs them not to associate with sexually immoral people who call themselves believers, quoting 'A little yeast works through the whole batch of dough' and 'Expel the wicked person from among you.'",
  "1 Corinthians 6": "When you have a dispute with another believer, how dare you take it before the ungodly for judgment instead of before the Lord's people who will judge the world? Don't you know your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, so you are not your own—you were bought at a price, therefore honor God with your bodies.",
  "1 Corinthians 7": "Concerning matters you wrote about, it is good for a man not to have sexual relations with a woman, but since sexual immorality is occurring, each man should have his own wife, and the wife does not have authority over her own body but her husband does. To the unmarried and widows Paul says it is good to stay as he is, but if they cannot control themselves, they should marry, for it is better to marry than to burn with passion, and he gives instructions about marriage, divorce, and remaining as you were when called.",
  "1 Corinthians 8": "Concerning food sacrificed to idols, 'We know that an idol is nothing' and 'We all possess knowledge,' but knowledge puffs up while love builds up. Be careful that the exercise of your rights does not become a stumbling block to the weak, for when you sin against them and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ.",
  "1 Corinthians 9": "Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Paul defends his apostolic authority and right to financial support but says he has not used these rights, choosing instead to preach the gospel free of charge. He has become all things to all people so that by all possible means he might save some, and he disciplines his body making it his slave so that after preaching to others, he himself will not be disqualified.",
  "1 Corinthians 10": "Paul warns them not to be idolaters like their ancestors in the wilderness who were judged despite experiencing miracles. These things happened as examples to keep us from setting our hearts on evil, and when tempted, God will provide a way out so you can endure it, so flee from idolatry, and whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God.",
  "1 Corinthians 11": "Paul addresses head coverings in worship, explaining man is the head of woman as Christ is the head of man. He rebukes them for divisions at the Lord's Supper where some go hungry while others get drunk, and he recounts the institution of the Lord's Supper, warning that those who eat and drink without recognizing the body eat and drink judgment on themselves.",
  "1 Corinthians 12": "There are different gifts but the same Spirit, different kinds of service but the same Lord, and to each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good. The body is a unit though made of many parts, and God has placed each part just as He wanted, so you are the body of Christ and each one is a part, and now I will show you the most excellent way.",
  "1 Corinthians 13": "If I speak in tongues but have not love, I am only a resounding gong; if I have faith that can move mountains but have not love, I am nothing. Love is patient and kind, does not envy or boast, is not proud or dishonest, keeps no record of wrongs, always protects, trusts, hopes, and perseveres, and now these three remain: faith, hope and love, but the greatest of these is love.",
  "1 Corinthians 14": "Follow the way of love and eagerly desire gifts of the Spirit, especially prophecy, for those who speak in a tongue edify themselves but those who prophesy edify the church. Paul would rather speak five intelligible words to instruct others than ten thousand words in a tongue, for God is not a God of disorder but of peace, so everything should be done in a fitting and orderly way.",
  "1 Corinthians 15": "Paul reminds them of the gospel—that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, was buried, was raised on the third day, and appeared to many including him, the least of the apostles. If Christ has not been raised, our preaching is useless and so is your faith, but Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep, and just as we have borne the image of the earthly man, we will bear the image of the heavenly man, for the dead will be raised imperishable and we will be changed.",
  "1 Corinthians 16": "Concerning the collection for the Lord's people, on the first day of every week each should set aside a sum according to your income. Paul plans to visit after passing through Macedonia and may spend winter with them, and he sends greetings from the churches in Asia, Aquila and Priscilla, and all the brothers and sisters, closing with 'My love to all of you in Christ Jesus.'",
  "2 Corinthians 1": "Paul thanks God who comforts us in all our troubles so we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves receive from God. He explains why he changed his travel plans—it was to spare them and not because he is fickle, for as surely as God is faithful, his message is not 'Yes' and 'No,' and it is God who makes us stand firm in Christ, anoints us, and puts His Spirit in our hearts as a deposit.",
  "2 Corinthians 2": "Paul decided not to make another painful visit but wrote with tears, not to grieve them but to let them know the depth of his love. He urges them to forgive and comfort the offender so Satan will not outwit them, for when he came to Troas and Titus wasn't there, he had no peace of mind, but thanks be to God who always leads us as captives in Christ's triumphal procession and uses us to spread the aroma of the knowledge of Him everywhere.",
  "2 Corinthians 3": "Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? You yourselves are our letter, written on our hearts, known and read by everyone, a letter from Christ written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God. We are ministers of a new covenant—not of the letter but of the Spirit, for the letter kills but the Spirit gives life, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom, and we are being transformed into His image with ever-increasing glory.",
  "2 Corinthians 4": "Since we have this ministry, we do not lose heart, for we do not preach ourselves but Jesus Christ as Lord, and God has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of His glory. We have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all-surpassing power is from God and not from us, and though outwardly we are wasting away, inwardly we are being renewed day by day, for our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all.",
  "2 Corinthians 5": "We know that if our earthly tent is destroyed, we have a building from God, an eternal house in heaven, and we live by faith, not by sight. For Christ's love compels us, because He died for all so those who live should no longer live for themselves but for Him, and if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come—the old has gone, the new is here! God reconciled us to Himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation, so we are Christ's ambassadors, as though God were making His appeal through us: Be reconciled to God.",
  "2 Corinthians 6": "As God's co-workers we urge you not to receive God's grace in vain, for now is the time of God's favor, now is the day of salvation. We put no stumbling block in anyone's path, but as servants of God we commend ourselves through great endurance in troubles, hardships, and distresses, and we open wide our hearts to you, so do not be yoked together with unbelievers, for what fellowship can light have with darkness?",
  "2 Corinthians 7": "Since we have these promises, let us purify ourselves from everything that contaminates body and spirit, perfecting holiness out of reverence for God. Paul rejoices that his previous letter brought them to repentance—not that they were made sorry but that their sorrow led to repentance, for godly sorrow brings repentance that leads to salvation, and Titus's spirit was refreshed by them all.",
  "2 Corinthians 8": "Paul urges the Corinthians to excel in the grace of giving, following the example of the Macedonian churches who gave beyond their ability despite extreme poverty. He reminds them that Christ became poor so that through His poverty they might become rich, and he is sending Titus and others to complete their generous gift so it will be ready, for each of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give.",
  "2 Corinthians 9": "Whoever sows sparingly will reap sparingly, and whoever sows generously will reap generously, so each should give what they have decided in their heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver. God is able to bless you abundantly so you will abound in every good work, and thanks be to God for His indescribable gift!",
  "2 Corinthians 10": "Paul appeals by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, defending his boldness—though we live in the world, we do not wage war as the world does, for the weapons we fight with have divine power to demolish strongholds. We will not boast beyond proper limits but will confine our boasting to the sphere of service God assigned to us, and let the one who boasts boast in the Lord.",
  "2 Corinthians 11": "I am jealous for you with a godly jealousy, for I promised you to one husband, to Christ, but I fear that just as Eve was deceived, your minds may be led astray. Paul defends his apostleship against false apostles who masquerade as apostles of Christ, and he recounts his sufferings—imprisonments, floggings, stonings, shipwrecks, dangers from rivers and bandits, sleepless nights, hunger and thirst—and besides everything else, he faces daily the pressure of his concern for all the churches.",
  "2 Corinthians 12": "Paul was caught up to the third heaven and heard inexpressible things, but to keep him from becoming conceited, he was given a thorn in his flesh. Three times he pleaded with the Lord to take it away, but God said 'My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness,' so Paul boasts in his weaknesses that Christ's power may rest on him.",
  "2 Corinthians 13": "This is my third visit to you, and every matter must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses, so examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith. Paul prays they will not do anything wrong and that they will be fully restored, and he closes: May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.",
  "Galatians 1": "Paul expresses astonishment that the Galatians are deserting the gospel for a different gospel, declaring that even if an angel from heaven preaches another gospel, let them be under God's curse. He explains he received his gospel not from any man but by revelation from Jesus Christ, and God set him apart from birth to preach Christ among the Gentiles.",
  "Galatians 2": "Paul recounts confronting Peter in Antioch for withdrawing from eating with Gentiles, declaring that a person is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ. He proclaims 'I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me.'",
  "Galatians 3": "Paul rebukes the foolish Galatians, asking whether they received the Spirit by works of the law or by believing what they heard. Just as Abraham believed God and it was credited to him as righteousness, those who have faith are children of Abraham, and Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law.",
  "Galatians 4": "When the set time had fully come, God sent His Son to redeem those under the law so we might receive adoption as sons. Paul uses the allegory of Sarah and Hagar to show that we are children of the free woman, not of slavery under the law.",
  "Galatians 5": "Christ has set us free, so stand firm and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery through circumcision. The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control.",
  "Galatians 6": "Brothers and sisters, if someone is caught in sin, restore that person gently and carry each other's burdens, fulfilling the law of Christ. Do not be deceived—a man reaps what he sows, so let us not become weary in doing good.",
  "Ephesians 1": "Paul praises God who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing, choosing us before the foundation of the world to be holy and blameless. In Him we have redemption through His blood and were marked with the seal of the promised Holy Spirit.",
  "Ephesians 2": "You were dead in your transgressions, but God made us alive with Christ—it is by grace you have been saved through faith, not by works. He has made Jews and Gentiles one, destroying the dividing wall, so you are fellow citizens and members of God's household.",
  "Ephesians 3": "Paul explains the mystery made known to him—that through the gospel the Gentiles are heirs together with Israel and members of one body. He prays they would know the love of Christ and be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God.",
  "Ephesians 4": "Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit—there is one body, one Spirit, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all. Put off your old self and put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness.",
  "Ephesians 5": "Walk in the way of love just as Christ loved us and gave Himself up as a fragrant offering, and be filled with the Spirit. Wives submit to your husbands as to the Lord, and husbands love your wives just as Christ loved the church.",
  "Ephesians 6": "Children, obey your parents in the Lord, and fathers, bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord. Put on the full armor of God—belt of truth, breastplate of righteousness, gospel of peace, shield of faith, helmet of salvation, and sword of the Spirit.",
  "Philippians 1": "Paul gives thanks for the Philippians' partnership in the gospel, confident that He who began a good work will carry it on to completion. For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain, yet it is more necessary that I remain for your progress in the faith.",
  "Philippians 2": "Have the same mindset as Christ Jesus who made Himself nothing, taking the nature of a servant and becoming obedient to death on a cross, therefore God exalted Him to the highest place. Continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God who works in you.",
  "Philippians 3": "Watch out for those who mutilate the flesh, for we who serve God by His Spirit are the true circumcision. Paul counts his former achievements as loss compared to knowing Christ, pressing on toward the goal to win the prize.",
  "Philippians 4": "Rejoice in the Lord always—do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation present your requests to God with thanksgiving. I can do all things through Him who gives me strength, and my God will meet all your needs.",
  "Colossians 1": "Paul thanks God for the Colossians' faith and prays they would be filled with knowledge of His will. The Son is the image of the invisible God in whom all things were created, and God was pleased to reconcile all things through Christ's blood.",
  "Colossians 2": "Paul warns them not to be taken captive through philosophy and empty deception, for in Christ all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form. You have been given fullness in Him who is the head over every power and authority.",
  "Colossians 3": "Since you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on things above where Christ is seated at God's right hand. As God's chosen people, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, patience, and above all, love.",
  "Colossians 4": "Masters, provide your slaves with what is right and fair, and devote yourselves to prayer, being wise toward outsiders. Paul sends greetings from his fellow workers including Tychicus, Onesimus, and Luke.",
  "1 Thessalonians 1": "Paul gives thanks for the Thessalonians' work of faith, labor of love, and endurance of hope in Jesus Christ. Your faith in God has become known everywhere so we do not need to say anything about it.",
  "1 Thessalonians 2": "You know our visit was not without results, for we had the courage to declare the gospel despite strong opposition. We were like a nursing mother caring for her little children and a father encouraging you to live lives worthy of God.",
  "1 Thessalonians 3": "When we could stand it no longer, we sent Timothy to strengthen and encourage you in your faith. Now Timothy has brought good news about your faith and love, and how can we thank God enough for the joy we have because of you?",
  "1 Thessalonians 4": "We urge you to live in order to please God, and God's will is your sanctification—that you should avoid sexual immorality. We do not want you to be uninformed about those who sleep in death, for at His coming the dead in Christ will rise first, then we who are alive will be caught up together with them to meet the Lord.",
  "1 Thessalonians 5": "The day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night, so let us not be like others who are asleep but be alert and sober. Rejoice always, pray continually, give thanks in all circumstances, and may your whole spirit, soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.",
  "2 Thessalonians 1": "Paul gives thanks for the Thessalonians' persevering faith and growing love despite persecutions and trials they are enduring. God will pay back trouble to those who trouble you and give relief when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire.",
  "2 Thessalonians 2": "Concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, don't let anyone deceive you—that day will not come until the rebellion occurs and the man of lawlessness is revealed. Stand firm and hold fast to the teachings passed on to you, and may our Lord Jesus Christ encourage your hearts.",
  "2 Thessalonians 3": "Finally, pray for us that the message of the Lord may spread rapidly and that we may be delivered from wicked people. We hear that some among you are idle, so such people we command to settle down and earn the food they eat.",
  "1 Timothy 1": "Paul urges Timothy to remain in Ephesus and command certain people not to teach false doctrines or devote themselves to myths and endless genealogies. Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners—of whom I am the worst—and Timothy should fight the good fight, holding on to faith and a good conscience.",
  "1 Timothy 2": "I urge that requests, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving be made for all people, for kings and those in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives. For there is one God and one mediator between God and mankind, the man Christ Jesus, who gave Himself as a ransom for all people.",
  "1 Timothy 3": "Whoever aspires to be an overseer desires a noble task, and an overseer must be above reproach, faithful to his wife, temperate, self-controlled, respectable, and able to teach. Deacons likewise must be worthy of respect, sincere, and must keep hold of the deep truths of the faith with a clear conscience.",
  "1 Timothy 4": "The Spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons. Train yourself to be godly, and don't let anyone look down on you because you are young, but set an example in speech, conduct, love, faith and purity.",
  "1 Timothy 5": "Do not rebuke an older man harshly but exhort him as a father, and treat younger men as brothers, older women as mothers, and younger women as sisters. Give proper recognition to widows who are really in need, and elders who direct the affairs of the church well are worthy of double honor.",
  "1 Timothy 6": "Those who are under the yoke of slavery should consider their masters worthy of full respect. People who want to get rich fall into temptation, for the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil, but you, man of God, pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance and gentleness.",
  "2 Timothy 1": "I am reminded of your sincere faith, which first lived in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice. God did not give us a spirit of timidity but a spirit of power, love and self-discipline, so do not be ashamed to testify about our Lord.",
  "2 Timothy 2": "You then, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus, and the things you have heard me say entrust to reliable people. Endure hardship like a good soldier of Christ Jesus, and if we died with Him, we will also live with Him.",
  "2 Timothy 3": "Mark this: There will be terrible times in the last days when people will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, and lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God. But as for you, continue in what you have learned, because all Scripture is God-breathed and useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness.",
  "2 Timothy 4": "In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, I give you this charge: Preach the word, be prepared in season and out of season, correct, rebuke and encourage. I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith, and now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness.",
  "Titus 1": "Paul writes to Titus in Crete to appoint elders in every town—men who are blameless, faithful to their wives, whose children believe. An overseer must be blameless as one entrusted with God's work, hospitable, self-controlled, upright, holy and disciplined, holding firmly to the trustworthy message.",
  "Titus 2": "Teach what accords with sound doctrine—older men are to be temperate and self-controlled; older women reverent; younger women to love their husbands; and young men to be self-controlled. The grace of God has appeared bringing salvation, teaching us to say 'No' to ungodliness and live self-controlled, upright and godly lives as we wait for the blessed hope.",
  "Titus 3": "Remind the people to be subject to rulers and authorities, to be obedient and ready to do whatever is good. When the kindness and love of God our Savior appeared, He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit, so that having been justified by His grace, we might become heirs.",
  "Philemon 1": "Paul appeals to Philemon on behalf of Onesimus, his slave who became a believer while with Paul, asking Philemon to welcome him back not as a slave but as a dear brother. Paul offers to repay anything Onesimus owes, confident that Philemon will do even more than he asks.",
  "Hebrews 1": "In the past God spoke through the prophets, but in these last days He has spoken through His Son, the radiance of God's glory and exact representation of His being. The Son is superior to angels—God never said to an angel 'You are my Son' or 'Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool.'",
  "Hebrews 2": "We must pay more careful attention to what we have heard, lest we drift away, for how shall we escape if we ignore so great a salvation? Since the children have flesh and blood, Jesus too shared in their humanity so that by His death He might break the power of him who holds the power of death.",
  "Hebrews 3": "Fix your thoughts on Jesus, our apostle and high priest, who was faithful to the one who appointed Him just as Moses was faithful in all God's house. Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts as you did in the rebellion during the time of testing in the wilderness.",
  "Hebrews 4": "Therefore, since the promise of entering His rest still stands, let us be careful that none of you be found to have fallen short. We have a great high priest who has ascended into heaven, Jesus the Son of God, who sympathizes with our weaknesses and was tempted in every way just as we are, yet without sin.",
  "Hebrews 5": "Every high priest is selected from among the people to represent them before God, offering gifts and sacrifices for sins. Christ did not take on Himself the glory of becoming a high priest but was called by God, and although He was a son, He learned obedience from what He suffered.",
  "Hebrews 6": "Let us move beyond the elementary teachings about Christ and be taken forward to maturity, not laying again the foundation of repentance and faith. It is impossible for those who have once been enlightened and shared in the Holy Spirit, if they fall away, to be brought back to repentance.",
  "Hebrews 7": "Melchizedek was without father or mother, without genealogy, without beginning of days or end of life, resembling the Son of God and remaining a priest forever. Jesus has become a high priest forever in the order of Melchizedek, able to save completely those who come to God through Him because He always lives to intercede for them.",
  "Hebrews 8": "We have such a high priest who sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven, a minister in the true tabernacle set up by the Lord. The ministry Jesus has received is superior to the old one, and the covenant of which He is mediator is founded on better promises.",
  "Hebrews 9": "The first covenant had regulations for worship and an earthly sanctuary where priests entered regularly, but only the high priest entered the Most Holy Place once a year with blood. Christ entered the Most Holy Place once for all by His own blood, obtaining eternal redemption, and just as people are destined to die once and face judgment, so Christ was sacrificed once to take away the sins of many.",
  "Hebrews 10": "The law is only a shadow of the good things to come, not the realities themselves, so it can never make perfect those who draw near to worship. By God's will we have been made holy through the sacrifice of Christ's body once for all, so let us draw near with a sincere heart in full assurance of faith.",
  "Hebrews 11": "Faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see, and by it the ancients were commended. By faith Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Moses, and others obeyed God, and all these people were still living by faith when they died, not having received what was promised but seeing it from a distance.",
  "Hebrews 12": "Since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and run with perseverance the race marked out for us, fixing our eyes on Jesus. Endure hardship as discipline, for God is treating you as His children, and no discipline seems pleasant at the time but later produces a harvest of righteousness and peace.",
  "Hebrews 13": "Keep on loving one another as brothers and sisters, show hospitality to strangers, honor marriage, and keep your lives free from the love of money. Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever, so through Jesus let us continually offer to God a sacrifice of praise.",
  "James 1": "Consider it pure joy when you face trials of many kinds, because the testing of your faith produces perseverance which must finish its work so you may be mature and complete. Do not merely listen to the word but do what it says, for anyone who listens but does not do is like someone who looks in a mirror and immediately forgets what they look like.",
  "James 2": "Believers in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ must not show favoritism, for if you show special attention to the rich but say to the poor 'Stand there,' have you not discriminated? Faith by itself, if not accompanied by action, is dead—show me your faith without deeds and I will show you my faith by my deeds.",
  "James 3": "Not many should become teachers, for we who teach will be judged more strictly, and we all stumble in many ways. The tongue is a small part of the body but makes great boasts—it is a fire, a restless evil full of deadly poison, and with it we bless the Lord and curse people made in God's image.",
  "James 4": "What causes fights and quarrels among you? Don't they come from your desires that battle within you—you desire but do not have, so you quarrel and fight. Submit yourselves to God, resist the devil and he will flee from you, draw near to God and He will draw near to you.",
  "James 5": "Now listen, you rich people, weep and wail because of the misery coming on you, for the wages you failed to pay the workers cry out against you. Be patient and stand firm because the Lord's coming is near, and the prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective.",
  "1 Peter 1": "Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ who in His great mercy has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ. You were redeemed not with perishable things like silver or gold but with the precious blood of Christ, a lamb without blemish or defect.",
  "1 Peter 2": "Rid yourselves of all malice, deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and slander, and like newborn babies, crave pure spiritual milk so you may grow up in your salvation. You are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God's special possession, that you may declare the praises of Him who called you out of darkness into His wonderful light.",
  "1 Peter 3": "Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands so that if any do not believe, they may be won over by your behavior, and husbands, be considerate and treat them with respect. Do not repay evil with evil or insult with insult, but with blessing, and always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope you have.",
  "1 Peter 4": "Since Christ suffered in His body, arm yourselves also with the same attitude, living the rest of your earthly life for God's will rather than evil human desires. Above all, love each other deeply because love covers a multitude of sins, and each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others.",
  "1 Peter 5": "To the elders: Be shepherds of God's flock under your care, watching over them not as lording it over those entrusted to you but being examples. Humble yourselves under God's mighty hand that He may lift you up in due time, casting all your anxiety on Him because He cares for you.",
  "2 Peter 1": "His divine power has given us everything we need for a godly life through our knowledge of Him who called us, and through these He has given us His very great and precious promises. Make every effort to add to your faith goodness, knowledge, self-control, perseverance, godliness, mutual affection and love.",
  "2 Peter 2": "False prophets appeared among the people, and there will be false teachers among you who will secretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the sovereign Lord. If God did not spare angels when they sinned but cast them to hell, and if He condemned Sodom yet rescued righteous Lot, then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trials.",
  "2 Peter 3": "Scoffers will come saying 'Where is this coming He promised?' but the day of the Lord will come like a thief—the heavens will disappear with a roar and the earth will be laid bare. Since you are looking forward to a new heaven and a new earth where righteousness dwells, make every effort to be found spotless, blameless and at peace with Him.",
  "1 John 1": "That which was from the beginning, which we have heard and seen with our eyes and touched with our hands, we proclaim to you—the Word of life appeared. If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves, but if we confess our sins, He is faithful and just and will forgive us and purify us from all unrighteousness.",
  "1 John 2": "My dear children, I write this to you so that you will not sin, but if anybody does sin, we have an advocate with the Father—Jesus Christ, the Righteous One. Do not love the world or anything in it, for the world and its desires pass away, but whoever does the will of God lives forever.",
  "1 John 3": "See what great love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God! And that is what we are. This is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down His life for us, and we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers and sisters.",
  "1 John 4": "Dear friends, do not believe every spirit but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world. God is love—whoever lives in love lives in God and God in them, and we love because He first loved us.",
  "1 John 5": "Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God, and everyone who loves the Father loves His child as well. This is love for God: to keep His commands, and His commands are not burdensome, for everyone born of God overcomes the world through faith.",
  "2 John 1": "The elder to the lady chosen by God and to her children: I rejoice to find some of your children walking in the truth, just as the Father commanded us. Many deceivers have gone out into the world who do not acknowledge Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh—such a person is the deceiver and the antichrist, so watch out that you do not lose what we have worked for.",
  "3 John 1": "The elder to my dear friend Gaius: I pray that you may enjoy good health and that all may go well with you, just as your soul is getting along well. You are faithful in what you are doing for the brothers and sisters, and I wrote to the church but Diotrephes, who loves to be first, will not welcome us.",
  "Jude 1": "Jude urges believers to contend for the faith that was once for all entrusted to God's holy people, for certain ungodly people have secretly slipped in among you who pervert the grace of God. Build yourselves up in your most holy faith and pray in the Holy Spirit, keep yourselves in God's love as you wait for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to bring you to eternal life.",
  "Revelation 1": "John, exiled on Patmos, receives a revelation from Jesus Christ to show His servants what must soon take place, declaring 'I am the Alpha and the Omega who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.' John sees someone like a son of man among seven golden lampstands with eyes like blazing fire, saying 'Do not be afraid. I am the First and the Last. I am the Living One; I was dead, and now look, I am alive for ever and ever!'",
  "Revelation 2": "Jesus gives messages to four churches: to Ephesus—you have forsaken your first love, repent; to Smyrna—be faithful even to death and I will give you life as your crown; to Pergamum—you have people who hold to false teaching, repent; to Thyatira—you tolerate Jezebel who teaches sexual immorality. To the one who is victorious, I will give authority over the nations.",
  "Revelation 3": "Jesus continues His messages: to Sardis—you have a reputation of being alive but you are dead, wake up; to Philadelphia—I have placed before you an open door that no one can shut; to Laodicea—you are lukewarm, neither hot nor cold, so I am about to spit you out of my mouth. I stand at the door and knock, and those whom I love I rebuke and discipline, so be earnest and repent.",
  "Revelation 4": "John sees a door standing open in heaven and a voice says 'Come up here, and I will show you what must take place after this.' Around the throne are twenty-four elders dressed in white with golden crowns, and four living creatures covered with eyes saying day and night 'Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty, who was, and is, and is to come.'",
  "Revelation 5": "John sees a scroll with seven seals in the right hand of Him on the throne, and he weeps because no one is found worthy to open it until an elder says 'See, the Lion of the tribe of Judah has triumphed. He is able to open the scroll.' Then John sees a Lamb looking as if it had been slain, and when He takes the scroll, all sing 'You are worthy because you were slain, and with your blood you purchased for God persons from every tribe and language and people and nation.'",
  "Revelation 6": "The Lamb opens the first four seals and four horsemen appear: a white horse whose rider conquers; a fiery red horse whose rider takes peace from the earth; a black horse whose rider brings famine; and a pale horse whose rider is Death. When the sixth seal is opened, there is a great earthquake, the sun turns black, the moon becomes like blood, and people hide in caves crying 'Fall on us and hide us from the face of Him who sits on the throne!'",
  "Revelation 7": "John sees four angels holding back the winds, and another angel ascends with the seal of the living God to seal 144,000 from the twelve tribes of Israel on their foreheads. After this John sees a great multitude from every nation, tribe, people, and language standing before the throne in white robes crying out 'Salvation belongs to our God who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb!'",
  "Revelation 8": "When the Lamb opens the seventh seal, there is silence in heaven for about half an hour, then seven angels are given seven trumpets. As the first four trumpets sound, hail and fire are hurled down, a mountain on fire is thrown into the sea, a star falls making waters bitter, and a third of the sun and moon are struck.",
  "Revelation 9": "The fifth angel sounds his trumpet and a star falls from heaven opening the Abyss, releasing locusts with power like scorpions to torment people for five months who do not have the seal of God. The sixth angel sounds his trumpet and four angels are released to kill a third of mankind, yet the rest of mankind still did not repent of their murders, magic arts, sexual immorality, or thefts.",
  "Revelation 10": "John sees a mighty angel coming down from heaven holding a little scroll, and when the angel gave a loud shout, seven thunders spoke but John is told to seal up what they said. The angel declares there will be no more delay—in the days of the seventh trumpet, the mystery of God will be accomplished, and John is told to take the scroll and eat it.",
  "Revelation 11": "John is given a measuring rod to measure the temple of God, and two witnesses prophesy for 1,260 days, and when they finish, the beast kills them, but after three and a half days God's breath enters them and they stand on their feet. The seventh angel sounds his trumpet and loud voices in heaven say 'The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Messiah, and he will reign for ever and ever.'",
  "Revelation 12": "A woman clothed with the sun gives birth to a son who will rule all nations, but an enormous red dragon tries to devour the child, who is snatched up to God's throne. War breaks out in heaven and Michael and his angels fight the dragon—the ancient serpent called the devil and Satan—who is hurled to the earth, and a loud voice declares 'Now have come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God.'",
  "Revelation 13": "John sees a beast coming out of the sea with ten horns and seven heads, and the dragon gives the beast his power, throne, and great authority, and the whole world follows the beast. Another beast comes out of the earth exercising all the authority of the first beast and forcing all people to receive a mark on their right hands or foreheads—the number of the beast is 666.",
  "Revelation 14": "John sees the Lamb standing on Mount Zion with 144,000 who have His name and His Father's name written on their foreheads, singing a new song before the throne. Three angels proclaim messages: fear God for the hour of His judgment has come; Babylon has fallen; and if anyone worships the beast and receives its mark, they will drink the wine of God's fury.",
  "Revelation 15": "John sees seven angels with the seven last plagues—last because with them God's wrath is completed. Those who had been victorious over the beast stand beside a sea of glass singing 'Great and marvelous are your deeds, Lord God Almighty. Just and true are your ways, King of the nations.'",
  "Revelation 16": "A loud voice from the temple tells the seven angels 'Go, pour out the seven bowls of God's wrath on the earth,' bringing painful sores, blood in seas and rivers, scorching sun, darkness over the beast's kingdom, and the Euphrates dries up. The seventh bowl brings the worst earthquake in history, destroying cities and islands.",
  "Revelation 17": "One of the seven angels shows John the judgment of the great prostitute sitting on many waters, drunk with the blood of God's holy people. She sits on a scarlet beast with seven heads and ten horns, and on her forehead is written MYSTERY: BABYLON THE GREAT, and the ten horns will hate the prostitute and bring her to ruin.",
  "Revelation 18": "Another angel cries out 'Fallen! Fallen is Babylon the Great!' and another voice calls 'Come out of her, my people, so that you will not share in her sins.' In one hour she has been brought to ruin, and merchants weep because no one buys their cargoes of gold, silver, precious stones, pearls, fine linen, and every kind of luxury.",
  "Revelation 19": "A great multitude in heaven shouts 'Hallelujah! Salvation and glory and power belong to our God!' and the wedding of the Lamb has come. John sees heaven standing open and a white horse whose rider is called Faithful and True with a name written on Him: KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS, and the beast and the kings of the earth are captured and thrown into the fiery lake.",
  "Revelation 20": "An angel seizes the dragon, that ancient serpent who is the devil and Satan, and binds him for a thousand years in the Abyss, and John sees thrones on which were seated those given authority to judge. When Satan is released, he deceives the nations but fire comes down from heaven and devours them, and the devil is thrown into the lake of burning sulfur, and the dead are judged according to what they have done.",
  "Revelation 21": "John sees a new heaven and a new earth, and the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband.

There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.'",
  "Revelation 22": "The angel shows John the river of the water of life flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb, and on each side of the river stands the tree of life bearing twelve crops of fruit, and no longer will there be any curse. Jesus declares 'Look, I am coming soon! Blessed is the one who keeps the words of the prophecy written in this scroll,' and the Spirit and the bride say 'Come!' and whoever is thirsty, let them come and take the free gift of the water of life."
