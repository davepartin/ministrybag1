The leader calls a number, and the players from each team with that number run to the center. The goal is to grab the bacon and get it back to your side without being tagged by the other player. If tagged while holding it, the bacon goes to the other team. Variations: use a water balloon for bacon to make it messy, use a sock filled with flour (chalk sock), use funny objects like a rubber fish for laughter."

Everyone then holds hands (or not, but it can add to misdirection) and the It is called back in. They walk around the inside of the circle and have to choose whose hands to grab. When they grab someone's hands, that person says nothing. However, the person *who actually has the keys* must jingle them at the exact moment It grabs any hands. The It hears the jingle and now must try to deduce who had the keys (because the jingle could come from anywhere since everyone's hands are linked or near each other). They get a few guesses. If they guess right, someone else becomes It; if not, they do another round."

    "players": "Varies",
    "equipment": "Depends on game",
    "rules": "Create a giant board on the floor or ground using tape or chalk. You can do Checkers with people as pieces (wearing red/black shirts maybe). Chess where people are the pieces and one person is the commander calling moves. Tic-Tac-Toe using 9 chairs and people holding X or O signs. Even a life-size Candyland or Chutes & Ladders on a tarp with players as pawns walking the board. Use cards or giant dice to move. Essentially take a familiar board game and scale it up to human size."

    "category": "Seasonal/Holiday Games",
    "players": "Teams in cars",
    "equipment": "List, cameras",
    "rules": "Around Christmas, give each car/team a list of outdoor holiday decorations to find (e.g., Santa inflatable, nativity scene, house with all blue lights, etc.). Teams drive around neighborhoods to find as many as possible within a time limit, taking a photo of each as proof. Or if together in a van, just check them off. Could also involve riddles (e.g., 'Find Rudolph in a yard' etc.). The team that finds the most or completes the list first wins."

    "category": "Seasonal/Holiday Games",
    "players": "Teams or individuals",
    "equipment": "Small pumpkins, 2-liter bottles",
    "rules": "In the fall, set up 2-liter soda bottles (filled with some water or sand for weight) as bowling pins. Use small roundish pumpkins as bowling balls. Players roll the pumpkins to knock down the 'pins'. The pumpkins won't roll straight, adding to fun. Can do standard 10-pin setup and scoring or just have each team knock down as many as possible with two rolls. After a while the pumpkins may crack, which is messy fun too."

    "equipment": "Plastic eggs, spoons",
    "rules": "This is a series of mini relays all involving plastic Easter eggs: (1) classic spoon race – each team member carries an egg in a spoon across and back, then transfers to next without dropping. (2) Over/under – pass eggs alternating over head and between legs down the line. (3) Egg toss – partners toss increasing distances without dropping (if drop, start over short distance). (4) Hunt – final player must find a hidden egg in a certain area. First team to finish all tasks wins."

    "players": "Pairs",
    "equipment": "Balloons with messages",
    "rules": "Write a bunch of short valentines messages or words on slips of paper. Make two of each so there's a pair (like 'Be Mine', 'True Love', etc.). Put each slip in a separate balloon and inflate them. Each person grabs a balloon at random and must find the person with the matching message. But to see the message, they have to pop the balloons (fun if done by hugging the balloon between them or other no-hands way). Once everyone pairs up, you can have them do something like introduce themselves."

    "category": "Seasonal/Holiday Games",
    "players": "Individuals",
    "equipment": "Balloons",
    "rules": "Great for Thanksgiving time. Each player places a balloon between their knees and must waddle (like a turkey) from the start to the finish line without dropping or popping the balloon. If the balloon drops, they must go back to where they dropped it and resume. If it pops, they're out or they get a penalty. First to the finish wins. You can race in heats if many players."
