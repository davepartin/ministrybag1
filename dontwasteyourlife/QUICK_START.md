2. **How does this chapter help you understand what it means to not waste your life?**
3. **What specific truth or concept from this chapter struck you most powerfully? Why?**

These questions encourage:

## A Note on the Questions

I deliberately chose these 5 questions because they:
1. Work for every chapter (not chapter-specific)
2. Promote deep engagement with the text
3. Move from understanding → application
4. Encourage gospel-centered reflection
5. Push toward concrete action
6. Align with pastoral/discipleship goals

This is simpler than having different questions for each chapter, but actually more powerful because users develop a consistent rhythm of reflection.
