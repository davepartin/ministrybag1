The unwasted life is based on the discovery\nthat our deepest joy and God’s beautiful majesty reach their apex\ntogether.\nThere is a warning. The path of God-exalting joy will cost you\nyour life. Jesus said, “Whoever loses his life for my sake and the\ngospel’s will save it” (Mark 8:35). In other words, it is better to\nlose your life than to waste it.\nIf you live gladly to make others glad in God, your life will be\nhard, your risks will be high, and your joy will be full. This is not\na book about how to avoid a wounded life, but how to avoid a\nwasted life. Some of you will die in the service of Christ. That will\nnot be a tragedy. Treasuring life above Christ is a tragedy.\nI hope I am wrong about Bob Dylan. When he says, “I’m not\ngoing to worry about what it all means,” maybe he really means,\n“I’m not going to worry, because I have discovered life’s great\nmeaning, and I don’t need to worry anymore.” Maybe he really\ndoes believe “The answer is blowin’ in the wind.” The answer.\nYou’ll see how that song figured into my story. It did not lead me\nto believe that there is no answer.\nPlease know that I am praying for you, whether you are a\nstudent dreaming something radical for your life or whether you\nare retired and hoping not to waste the final years. If you wonder\nwhat I am praying, read chapter 10. It is my prayer.\nFor now, I thank God for you. My joy grows with every soul\nthat seeks the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. Remember, you have one life. That’s all. You were made for God. Don’t\nwaste it.\nJohn Piper\nSeptember 12, 2017\n\n\f1",

      "content": "My Search for a Single\nPassion to Live By\n\nMy father was an evangelist. When I was a boy, there were rare\noccasions when my mother and sister and I traveled with him and\nheard him preach. I trembled to hear my father preach. In spite\nof the predictable opening humor, the whole thing struck me as\nabsolutely blood-earnest. There was a certain squint to his eye and\na tightening of his lips when the avalanche of biblical texts came\nto a climax in application.\n\n“I’ve Wasted It, I’ve Wasted It”\nOh, how he would plead! Children, teenagers, young singles,\nyoung married people, the middle-aged, old people—he would\npress the warnings and the wooings of Christ into the heart of\neach person. He had stories, so many stories, for each age group—\nstories of glorious conversions, and stories of horrific refusals to\nbelieve followed by tragic deaths. Seldom could those stories come\nwithout tears.\nFor me as a boy, one of the most gripping illustrations my\nfiery father used was the story of a man converted in old age. The\n\n[PAGE 12]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\nchurch had prayed for this man for decades. He was hard and\nresistant. But this time, for some reason, he showed up when my\nfather was preaching. At the end of the service, during a hymn, to\neveryone’s amazement he came and took my father’s hand. They\nsat down together on the front pew of the church as the people\nwere dismissed. God opened his heart to the gospel of Christ, and\nhe was saved from his sins and given eternal life. But that did not\nstop him from sobbing and saying, as the tears ran down his wrinkled face—and what an impact it made on me to hear my father\nsay this through his own tears—“I’ve wasted it! I’ve wasted it!”\nThis was the story that gripped me more than all the stories\nof young people who died in car wrecks before they were converted—the story of an old man weeping that he had wasted his\nlife. In those early years God awakened in me a fear and a passion\nnot to waste my life. The thought of coming to my old age and\nsaying through tears, “I’ve wasted it! I’ve wasted it!” was a fearful\nand horrible thought to me.\n\n“Only One Life, ’Twill Soon Be Past”\nAnother riveting force in my young life—small at first, but oh so\npowerful over time—was a plaque that hung in our kitchen over\nthe sink. We moved into that house when I was six. So I suppose\nI looked at the words on that plaque almost every day for twelve\nyears, till I went away to college at age eighteen. It was a simple\npiece of glass painted black on the back with a gray link chain\nsnug around it for a border and for hanging. On the front, in old\nEnglish script, painted in white, were the words:\nOnly one life,\n’Twill soon be past;\nOnly what’s done\nfor Christ will last.\n\nTo the left, beside these words, was a painted green hill with two\ntrees and a brown path that disappeared over the hill. How many\n\n\fMy Search for a Single Passion to Live By\n\n[PAGE 13]\n\ntimes, as a little boy, and then as a teenager with pimples and\nlongings and anxieties, I looked at that brown path (my life) and\nwondered what would be over that hill. The message was clear.\nYou get one pass at life. That’s all. Only one. And the lasting\nmeasure of that life is Jesus Christ. That very plaque hung on the\nwall by our front door for years. I saw it every time I left home.\nWhat would it mean to waste my life? That was a burning\nquestion. Or, more positively, what would it mean to live well—\nnot to waste life, but to . . . ? How to finish that sentence was the\nquestion. I was not even sure how to put the question into words,\nlet alone what the answer might be. What was the opposite of\nnot wasting my life? “To be successful in a career”? Or “to be\nmaximally happy”? Or “to accomplish something great”? Or “to\nfind the deepest meaning and significance”? Or “to help as many\npeople as possible”? Or “to serve Christ to the full”? Or “to glorify God in all I do”? Or was there a point, a purpose, a focus, an\nessence to life that would fulfill every one of those dreams?\n\n“The Lost Years”\nI had forgotten how weighty this question was for me until I\nlooked through my files from those early years. Just when I was\nabout to leave my South Carolina home in 1964, never to return\nas a resident, Wade Hampton High School published a simple\nliterary magazine of poems and stories. Near the back, with the\nbyline Johnny Piper, was a poem. I will spare you. It was not a\ngood poem. Jane, the editor, was merciful. What matters to me\nnow was the title and first four lines. It was called “The Lost\nYears.” Beside it was a sketch of an old man in a rocking chair.\nThe poem began:\nLong I sought for the earth’s hidden meaning;\nLong as a youth was my search in vain.\nNow as I approach my last years waning,\nMy search I must begin again.\n\n[PAGE 14]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\nAcross the fifty years that separate me from that poem I can\nhear the fearful refrain, “I’ve wasted it! I’ve wasted it!” Somehow\nthere had been wakened in me a passion for the essence and the\nmain point of life. The ethical question “whether something is permissible” faded in relation to the question, “what is the main thing,\nthe essential thing?” The thought of building a life around minimal\nmorality or minimal significance—a life defined by the question,\n“What is permissible?”—felt almost disgusting to me. I didn’t want\na minimal life. I didn’t want to live on the outskirts of reality. I\nwanted to understand the main thing about life and pursue it.\n\nExistentialism Was the Air We Breathed\nThe passion not to miss the essence of life, not to waste it, intensified in college—the tumultuous late sixties. There were strong\nreasons for this, reasons that go well beyond the inner turmoil of\none boy coming of age. “Essence” was under assault almost everywhere. Existentialism was the air we breathed. And the meaning of\nexistentialism was that “existence precedes essence.” That is, first\nyou exist and then, by existing, you create your essence. You make\nyour essence by freely choosing to be what you will be. There is\nno essence outside you to pursue or conform to. Call it “God”\nor “meaning” or “purpose”—it is not there until you create it by\nyour own courageous existence. (If you furrow your brow and\nthink, “This sounds strangely like our own day and what we call\npostmodernism,” don’t be surprised. There is nothing new under\nthe sun. There are only endless repackagings.)\nI recall sitting in a darkened theater watching the theatrical\noffspring of existentialism, the “theater of the absurd.” The play\nwas Samuel Beckett’s Waiting for Godot. Vladimir and Estragon\nmeet under a tree and converse as they wait for Godot. He never\ncomes. Near the end of the play a boy tells them Godot will not be\ncoming. They decide to leave but never move. They go nowhere.\nThe curtain falls, and God[ot] never comes.\nThat was Beckett’s view of people like me—waiting, seeking,\n\n\fMy Search for a Single Passion to Live By\n\n[PAGE 15]\n\nhoping to find the Essence of things, instead of creating my own\nessence with my free and unbridled existence. Nowhere—that’s\nwhere you’re going, he implied, if you pursue some transcendent\nPoint or Purpose or Focus or Essence.\n\n“The Nowhere Man”\nThe Beatles released their album Rubber Soul in December 1965\nand sang out their existentialism with compelling power for my generation. Perhaps it was clearest in John Lennon’s “Nowhere Man.”\nHe’s a real nowhere man\nSitting in his nowhere land\nMaking all his nowhere plans\nFor nobody\nDoesn’t have a point of view\nKnows not where he’s going to\nIsn’t he a bit like you and me?\n\nThese were heady days, especially for college students. And,\nthankfully, God was not silent. Not everybody gave way to the\nlure of the absurd and the enticement of heroic emptiness. Not\neveryone caved in to the summons of Albert Camus and Jean-Paul\nSartre. Even voices without root in the Truth knew that there must\nbe something more—something outside ourselves, something bigger and greater and more worth living for than what we saw in\nthe mirror.\n\nThe Answer, the Answer Was Blowin’ in the Wind\nBob Dylan was scratching out songs with oblique messages of\nhope that exploded on the scene precisely because they hinted at\na Reality that would not keep us waiting forever. Things would\nchange. Sooner or later the slow would be fast and the first would\nbe last. And it would not be because we were existential masters\nof our absurd fate. It would come to us. That is what we all felt\nin the song, “The Times They Are A-Changin’.”\n\n[PAGE 16]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\nThe line it is drawn,\nThe curse it is cast,\nThe slow one now\nWill later be fast.\nAs the present now\nWill later be past,\nThe order is\nRapidly fadin’.\nAnd the first one now\nWill later be last,\nFor the times they are a-changin’.\n\nIt must have riled the existentialists to hear Dylan, perhaps\nwithout even knowing it, sweep away their everything-goes relativism with the audacious double “The answer . . . The answer”\nin the smash hit, “Blowin’ in the Wind.”\nHow many times must a man look up\nBefore he can see the sky?\nYes, ’n’ how many ears must one man have\nBefore he can hear people cry?\nYes, ’n’ how many deaths will it take till he knows\nThat too many people have died?\nThe answer, my friend, is blowin’ in the wind,\nThe answer is blowin’ in the wind.\n\nHow many times can a man look up and not see the sky?\nThere is a sky up there to be seen. You may look up ten thousand\ntimes and say you don’t see it. But that has absolutely no effect\non its objective existence. It is there. And one day you will see it.\nHow many times must you look up before you see it? There is an\nanswer. The answer, The answer, my friend, is not yours to invent\nor create. It will be decided for you. It is outside you. It is real and\nobjective and firm. One day you will hear it. You don’t create it.\nYou don’t define it. It comes to you, and sooner or later you conform to it—or bow to it.\n\n\fMy Search for a Single Passion to Live By\n\n[PAGE 17]\n\nThat is what I heard in Dylan’s song, and everything in me said,\nYes! There is an Answer with a capital A. To miss it would mean\na wasted life. To find it would mean having a unifying Answer to\nall my questions.\nThe little brown path over the green hill on our kitchen plaque\nwas winding its way—all through the sixties—among the sweet\nsnares of intellectual folly. Oh, how courageous my generation\nseemed when they stepped off the path and put their foot in the\ntrap! Some could even muster the moxie to boast, “I have chosen the way of freedom. I have created my own existence. I have\nshaken loose the old laws. Look how my leg is severed!”\n\nThe Man with Long Hair and Knickers\nBut God was graciously posting compelling warnings along the\nway. In the fall of 1965 Francis Schaeffer delivered a week of\nlectures at Wheaton College that in 1968 became the book, The\nGod Who Is There.1 The title shows the stunning simplicity of\nthe thesis. God is there. Not in here, defined and shaped by my\nown desires. God is out there. Objective. Absolute Reality (which\nSchaeffer pronounced something like “Reawity”). All that looks\nlike reality to us is dependent on God. There is creation and Creator, nothing more. And creation gets all its meaning and purpose\nfrom God.\nHere was an absolutely compelling road sign. Stay on the road\nof objective truth. This will be the way to avoid wasting your life.\nStay on the road that your fiery evangelist father was on. Don’t\nforsake the plaque on your kitchen wall. Here was weighty intellectual confirmation that life would be wasted in the grasslands of\nexistentialism. Stay on the road. There is Truth. There is a Point\nand Purpose and Essence to it all. Keep searching. You will find it.\nI suppose there is no point lamenting that one must spend his\n1. Schaeffer’s prophetic work remains incredibly relevant to our age. I’d encourage every\none of my readers to read at least one work by Schaeffer. A good place to begin with the\n“best of the best” is The Francis A. Schaeffer Trilogy: The God Who Is There, Escape from\nReason, and He Is There and He Is Not Silent (Wheaton, IL: Crossway, 1990).\n\n[PAGE 18]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\ncollege years learning the obvious—that there is Truth, that there\nis objective being and objective value. Like a fish going to school\nto learn that there is water, or a bird that there is air, or a worm\nthat there is dirt. But it seems that, for the last two hundred years\nor so, this has been the main point of good education. And its opposite is the essence of bad education. So I don’t lament the years\nI spent learning the obvious.\n\nThe Man Who Taught Me to See\nIndeed, I thank God for professors and writers who devoted tremendous creative energies to render credible the existence of trees\nand water and souls and love and God. C. S. Lewis, who died the\nsame day as John F. Kennedy in 1963 and who taught English at\nOxford, walked up over the horizon of my little brown path in\n1964 with such blazing brightness that it is hard to overstate the\nimpact he had on my life.\nSomeone introduced me to Lewis my freshman year with the\nbook, Mere Christianity.2 For the next five or six years I was almost never without a Lewis book near at hand. I think that without his influence I would not have lived my life with as much joy\nor usefulness as I have. There are reasons for this.\nHe has made me wary of chronological snobbery. That is,\nhe showed me that newness is no virtue and oldness is no vice.\nTruth and beauty and goodness are not determined by when they\nexist. Nothing is inferior for being old, and nothing is valuable for\nbeing modern. This has freed me from the tyranny of novelty and\nopened for me the wisdom of the ages. To this day I get most of my\nsoul-food from centuries ago. I thank God for Lewis’s compelling\ndemonstration of the obvious.\nHe demonstrated for me and convinced me that rigorous, precise, penetrating logic is not opposed to deep, soul-stirring feeling\nand vivid, lively—even playful—imagination. He was a “romantic\n2. C. S. Lewis, Mere Christianity (New York: Macmillan, 1952).\n\n\fMy Search for a Single Passion to Live By\n\n[PAGE 19]\n\nrationalist.” He combined things that almost everybody today assumes are mutually exclusive: rationalism and poetry, cool logic\nand warm feeling, disciplined prose and free imagination. In shattering these old stereotypes, he freed me to think hard and to write\npoetry, to argue for the resurrection and compose hymns to Christ,\nto smash an argument and hug a friend, to demand a definition\nand use a metaphor.\nLewis gave me an intense sense of the “realness” of things. The\npreciousness of this is hard to communicate. To wake up in the\nmorning and be aware of the firmness of the mattress, the warmth\nof the sun’s rays, the sound of the clock ticking, the sheer being of\nthings (“quiddity” as he calls it3). He helped me become alive to\nlife. He helped me see what is there in the world—things that, if\nwe didn’t have, we would pay a million dollars to have, but having\nthem, ignore. He made me more alive to beauty. He put my soul\non notice that there are daily wonders that will waken worship\nif I open my eyes. He shook my dozing soul and threw the cold\nwater of reality in my face, so that life and God and heaven and\nhell broke into my world with glory and horror.\nHe exposed the sophisticated intellectual opposition to objective being and objective value for the naked folly that it was.\nThe philosophical king of my generation had no clothes on, and\nthe writer of children’s books from Oxford had the courage to\nsay so.\nYou can’t go on “seeing through” things forever. The whole\npoint of seeing through something is to see something through\nit. It is good that the window should be transparent, because\nthe street or garden beyond it is opaque. How if you saw\nthrough the garden too? It is no use trying to “see through”\nfirst principles. If you see through everything, then everything\nis transparent. But a wholly transparent world is an invisible\nworld. To “see through” all things is the same as not to see.4\n3. C. S. Lewis, Surprised by Joy (New York: Harcourt, Brace and World, 1955), 199.\n4. C. S. Lewis, The Abolition of Man (New York: Macmillan, 1947), 91.\n\n[PAGE 20]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\nOh, how much more could be said about the world as C. S.\nLewis saw it and the way he spoke. He has his flaws, some of them\nserious. But I will never cease to thank God for this remarkable\nman who came onto my path at the perfect moment.\n\nA Fiancée Is a Stubbornly Objective Fact\nThere was another force that solidified my unwavering belief in\nthe unbending existence of objective reality. Her name was Noël\nHenry. I fell in love with her in the summer of 1966. Way too\nsoon probably. But it has turned out okay; I still love her. Nothing\nsobers a wandering philosophical imagination like the thought of\nhaving a wife and children to support.\nWe were married in December 1968. It is a good thing to\ndo one’s thinking in relation to real people. From that moment\non, every thought has been a thought in relationship. Nothing\nis merely an idea, but an idea that bears on my wife, then later,\non my five children and an increasing number of grandchildren.\nI thank God for the parable of Christ and the church that I have\nbeen obliged to live these forty years. There are lessons in life—the\nunwasted life—that I would probably never have learned without\nthis relationship (just as there are lessons in lifelong singleness that\nwill probably be learned no other way).\n\nI Bless You, Mono, for My Life\nIn the fall of 1966 God was closing in with an ever narrowing\npath for my life. When he made his next decisive move, Noël\nwondered where I had gone. The fall semester had started, and I\ndid not show up in classes or in chapel. Finally she found me, flat\non my back with mononucleosis in the health center, where I lay\nfor three weeks. The life plan that I was so sure of four months\nearlier unraveled in my fevered hands.\nIn May I had felt a joyful confidence that my life would be\nmost useful as a medical doctor. I loved biology; I loved the idea\nof healing people. I loved knowing, at last, what I was doing in\n\n\fMy Search for a Single Passion to Live By\n\n[PAGE 21]\n\ncollege. So I quickly took general chemistry in summer school so\nI could catch up and take organic chemistry that fall.\nNow with mono, I had missed three weeks of organic chemistry. There was no catching up. But even more important, Harold\nJohn Ockenga, then pastor of Park Street Church in Boston, was\npreaching in chapel each morning during the spiritual emphasis\nweek. I was listening on WETN, the college radio station. Never\nhad I heard exposition of the Scriptures like this. Suddenly all the\nglorious objectivity of Reality centered for me on the Word of\nGod. I lay there feeling as if I had awakened from a dream, and\nknew, now that I was awake, what I was to do.\nNoël came to visit, and I said, “What would you think if I\ndidn’t pursue a medical career but instead went to seminary?” As\nwith every other time I’ve asked that kind of question through\nthe years, the answer was, “If that’s where God leads you, that’s\nwhere I’ll go.” From that moment on I have never doubted that\nmy calling in life is to be a minister of the Word of God.\n\n\f\f2\n\nBreakthrough—\nThe Beauty of Christ, My Joy\n\nIn 1968 I had no idea what it would mean for me to be a minister of the Word. Being a pastor was as far from my expectations\nas being a pastor’s wife was from Noël’s. What then? Would it\nmean being a teacher, a missionary, a writer, maybe a professor\nof literature with good theology? All I knew was that ultimate\nReality had suddenly centered for me on the Word of God. The\ngreat Point and Purpose and Essence that I longed to link up with\nwas now connected unbreakably with the Bible. The mandate was\nclear: “Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a\nworker who has no need to be ashamed, rightly handling the word\nof truth” (2 Tim. 2:15). For me, that meant seminary, with a focus\non understanding and rightly handling the Bible.\n\nLearning Not to Cut Off My Own Head\nThe battle to learn the obvious continued. The modern assault on\nreality—that there exists a real objective reality outside ourselves\nthat can be truly known—had turned Bible study into a swamp of\nsubjectivity. You could see it in the church as small groups shared\n\n[PAGE 24]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\ntheir subjective impressions about what Bible texts meant “for\nme” without an anchor in any original meaning. And you could\nsee it in academic books as creative scholars cut their own heads\noff by arguing that texts have no objective meaning.\nIf there is only one life to live in this world, and if it is not to\nbe wasted, nothing seemed more important to me than finding out\nwhat God really meant in the Bible, since he inspired men to write\nit. If that was up for grabs, then no one could tell which life is worthy and which life is wasted. I was stunned at the gamesmanship\nin the scholarly world as authors used all their intellectual powers\nto nullify what they themselves wrote! That is, they expressed\ntheories of meaning that argued there is no single, valid meaning\nin texts. Ordinary people reading this book will (I hope) find this\nincredible. I don’t blame you. It is. But the fact remains that to\nthis day well-paid, well-fed professors use tuition and tax dollars\nto argue that “since literature does not accurately convey reality,\nliterary interpretation need not accurately convey the reality which\nis literature.”1\nIn other words, since we can’t know objective reality outside\nourselves, there can be no objective meaning in what we write,\neither. So interpretation does not mean trying to find any objective thing that an author put in a text, but simply means that we\nexpress the ideas that enter our head as we read. Which doesn’t\nreally matter because when others read what we have written, they\nwon’t have any access to our intention either. It’s all a game. Only\nit is sinister, because all these scholars (and small-group members)\ninsist that their own love letters and contracts be measured by\none rule: what they intended to say. Any mumbo-jumbo about\ncreatively hearing “yes” when I wrote “no” will not go down at\nthe bank or the marriage counselor.\nAnd so it was that Existentialism came home to roost in the\nBible: existence precedes essence. That is, I don’t find meaning—\n1. E. D. Hirsch, Validity in Interpretation (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1967),\nix. This quote does not reflect what Hirsch believes but what he is arguing against.\n\n\fBreakthrough—The Beauty of Christ, My Joy\n\n[PAGE 25]\n\nI create it. The Bible is a lump of clay, and I am the potter. Interpretation is creation. My existence as a subject creates the “essence”\nof the object. Don’t laugh. They were serious. They still are. Today\nit just has other names.\n\nDefending the Brightness of the Broad-Day Sun\nInto this morass of subjectivity came a professor of literature from\nthe University of Virginia, E. D. Hirsch. Reading his book Validity in Interpretation during my seminary years was like suddenly\nfinding a rock under my feet in the quicksand of contemporary\nconcepts about meaning. Like most of the guides God sent along\nmy path, Hirsch defended the obvious. Yes, he argued, there does\nexist an original meaning that a writer had in his mind when he\nwrote. And yes, valid interpretation seeks that intention in the text\nand gives good reasons for claiming to see it. This seemed as obvious to me as the broad-day sun. It was everybody’s assumption in\ndaily life when they spoke or wrote.\nPerhaps even more important, it seemed courteous. None of us\nwants our notes and letters and contracts interpreted differently\nthan we intend them. Therefore, common courtesy, or the Golden\nRule, requires that we read others the way we would be read. It\nseemed to me that much philosophical talk about meaning was\njust plain hypocritical: at the university I undermine objective\nmeaning, but at home (and at the bank) I insist on it. I wanted\nno part of that game. It looked like an utterly wasted life. If there\nis no valid interpretation based on real objective, unchanging,\noriginal meaning, then my whole being said, “Let us eat, drink,\nand be merry. But by no means let us treat scholarship as if it really matters.”\n\nThe Death of God and the Death of Meaning\nThings were coming together. On a cool April afternoon back in\n1966 at Wheaton College I had taken the new Time Magazine to\na second-floor corner of the library and read the cover story: “Is\n\n[PAGE 26]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\nGod Dead?” (April 8, 1966). “Christian atheists” like Thomas J. J.\nAltizer answered, yes. It was not new news. Friedrich Nietzsche\nhad given the obituary a hundred years earlier: “Whither is God?\n. . . I will tell you. We have killed him—you and I. All of us are\nhis murderers. . . . God is dead. God remains dead and we have\nkilled him.”2 It was a costly confession: Nietzsche spent the last\neleven years of his life in a semi-catatonic state and died in 1900.\nBut the courageous “Christian atheists” of the sixties did not\ncompute the costs of being God’s replacement as supermen (which\nNietzsche called them). The strong drink of Existentialism loosened the tongues of those creative theologians, like the men five\nrows back in the airplane after too many beers. So the suicidal\nassertion that God is dead was spoken again. And when God\ndied, the meaning of texts died. If the basis of objective reality\ndies, then writing and speaking about objective reality die. It all\nhangs together.\nSo my deliverance in the late sixties from the madness of killing\nGod led naturally in the early seventies to my deliverance from the\nhypocritical emptiness of hermeneutical subjectivism—the twofaced notion that there is no objective meaning in any sentence\n(but this one). Now I was ready for the real work of seminary:\nfinding what the Bible said about how not to waste my life.\n\nLearning the “Severe Discipline” of Reading the Bible\nMy debt at this point to Daniel Fuller is incalculable. He taught\nhermeneutics—the science of how to interpret the Bible. Not\nonly did he introduce me to E. D. Hirsch and force me to read\nhim with rigor, but he also taught me how to read the Bible with\nwhat Matthew Arnold called “severe discipline.” He showed\nme the obvious: that the verses of the Bible are not strung pearls\nbut links in a chain. The writers developed unified patterns of\n2. The quote is from aphorism 125 titled “The Madman,” in The Joyful Science, cited in\nDamon Linker, “Nietzsche’s Truth,” First Things 125 (August/September 2002): 54; available online at http://www.firstthings.com/ftissues/ft0208/articles/linker.html.\n\n\fBreakthrough—The Beauty of Christ, My Joy\n\n[PAGE 27]\n\nthought. They reasoned. “Come now, let us reason together,\nsays the Lord” (Isa. 1:18). This meant that, in each paragraph\nof Scripture, one should ask how each part related to the other\nparts in order to say one coherent thing. Then the paragraphs\nshould be related to each other in the same way. And then the\nchapters, then the books, and so on until the unity of the Bible\nis found on its own terms.\nI felt like my little brown path of life had entered an orchard,\na vineyard, a garden with mind-blowing, heart-thrilling, lifechanging fruit to be picked everywhere. Never had I seen so much\ntruth and so much beauty condensed in so small a sphere. The\nBible seemed to me then, and it seems today, inexhaustible. This is\nwhat I had dreamed about in the health center with mono, when\nGod called me to the ministry of the Word. Now the question\nbecame: What is the Point, the Purpose, the Focus, the Essence of\nthis beautiful glimpse of divine Truth?\n\nA Glimpse of Why I and Everything Exist\nIn course after course the pieces were put in place. What a gift\nthose three years of seminary were! In the final class with Dr.\nFuller, called “The Unity of the Bible” (which is also a book by\nthat title3) the unifying flag was hoisted over the whole Bible.\nGod ordained a redemptive history whose sequence fully displays his glory so that, at the end, the greatest possible number\nof people would have had the historical antecedents necessary\nto engender [the most] fervent love for God. . . . The one\nthing God is doing in all of redemptive history is to show\nforth his mercy in such a way that the greatest number of\npeople will throughout eternity delight in him with all their\nheart, strength, and mind. . . . When the earth of the new creation is filled with such people, then God’s purpose in showing\nforth his mercy will have been achieved. . . . All the events of\n3. Daniel Fuller, The Unity of the Bible: Unfolding God’s Plan for Humanity (Grand\nRapids, MI: Zondervan, 1992).\n\n[PAGE 28]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\nredemptive history and their meaning as recorded in the Bible\ncompose a unity in that they conjoin to bring about this goal.4\n\nContained in these sentences were the seeds of my future. The\ndriving passion of my life was rooted here. One of the seeds was in\nthe word “glory”—God’s aim in history was to “fully display his\nglory.” Another seed was in the word “delight”—God’s aim was\nthat his people “delight in him with all their heart.” The passion\nof my life has been to understand and live and teach and preach\nhow these two aims of God relate to each other—indeed, how they\nare not two but one.\nIt was becoming clearer and clearer that if I wanted to come\nto the end of my life and not say, “I’ve wasted it!” then I would\nneed to press all the way in, and all the way up, to the ultimate\npurpose of God and join him in it. If my life was to have a single,\nall-satisfying, unifying passion, it would have to be God’s passion.\nAnd, if Daniel Fuller was right, God’s passion was the display of\nhis own glory and the delight of my heart.\nAll of my life since that discovery has been spent experiencing\nand examining and explaining that truth. It has become clearer\nand more certain and more demanding with every year. It has\nbecome clearer that God being glorified and God being enjoyed\nare not separate categories. They relate to each other not like fruit\nand animals, but like fruit and apples. Apples are one kind of fruit.\nEnjoying God supremely is one way to glorify him. Enjoying God\nmakes him look supremely valuable.\n\nAn Eighteenth-Century Preacher\nSealed the Breakthrough\nJonathan Edwards came into my life at this time with the most\npowerful confirmation of this truth I have ever seen outside the\nBible. It was powerful because he showed that it was in the Bible.\nIn 2003 we marked his 300th birthday. He was a pastor and theo4. Ibid., 453–54.\n\n\fBreakthrough—The Beauty of Christ, My Joy\n\n[PAGE 29]\n\nlogian in New England. For me he has become the most important dead teacher outside the Bible. No one outside Scripture has\nshaped my vision of God and the Christian life more than Jonathan Edwards.\nI thank God that Edwards did not waste his life. It ended\nabruptly from a failed smallpox vaccination when he was fiftyfour. But he had lived well. His life is inspiring because of his zeal\nnot to waste it and because of his passion for the supremacy of\nGod. Consider some of the resolutions he wrote in his early twenties to intensify his life for the glory of God.\n• Resolution #5: “Resolved, never to lose one moment of\ntime; but improve it the most profitable way I possibly\ncan.”\n• Resolution #6: “Resolved, to live with all my might, while\nI do live.”\n• Resolution #17: “Resolved, that I will live so, as I shall\nwish I had done when I come to die.”\n• Resolution #22: “Resolved, to endeavor to obtain for myself as much happiness, in the other world, as I possibly\ncan, with all the power, might, vigor, and vehemence, yea\nviolence, I am capable of, or can bring myself to exert, in\nany way that can be thought of.”5\n\nThis last resolution (#22) may strike us as blatantly selfcentered, even dangerous, if we do not understand the deep connection in Edwards’s mind between the glory of God and the\nhappiness of Christians. The violence he had in mind was what\nJesus meant when he said in essence, “Better to gouge out your eye\nto kill lust and go to heaven than to make peace with sin and go to\nhell” (Matt. 5:29). And with regard to seeking his own happiness,\nkeep in mind that Edwards was absolutely convinced that being\nhappy in God was the way we glorify him. This was the reason\n5. Jonathan Edwards, The Works of Jonathan Edwards, ed. Edward Hickman, 2 vols.\n(Edinburgh: Banner of Truth, 1976), 1:xx-xxi.\n\n[PAGE 30]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\nwe were created. Delighting in God was not a mere preference or\noption in life; it was our joyful duty and should be the single passion of our lives. Therefore to resolve to maximize his happiness\nin God was to resolve to show him more glorious than all other\nsources of happiness. Seeking happiness in God and glorifying\nGod were the same.\n\nThe Great Coming Together for Me\nHere is how Edwards explained it. He preached a sermon when\nhe was still in his early twenties with this main point: “The godly\nare designed for unknown and inconceivable happiness.” His text\nwas 1 John 3:2, “And it doth not yet appear what we shall be”\n(KJV).\n[The] glory of God [does not] consist merely in the creature’s\nperceiving his perfections: for the creature may perceive the\npower and wisdom of God, and yet take no delight in it, but\nabhor it. Those creatures that so do, don’t glorify God. Nor\ndoth the glory of God consist especially in speaking of his\nperfections: for words avail not any otherwise than as they express the sentiment of the mind. This glory of God, therefore,\n[consists] in the creature’s admiring and rejoicing [and] exulting in the manifestation of his beauty and excellency. . . . The\nessence of glorifying . . . God consists, therefore, in the creature’s rejoicing in God’s manifestations of his beauty, which is\nthe joy and happiness we speak of. So we see it comes to this at\nlast: that the end of the creation is that God may communicate\nhappiness to the creature; for if God created the world that he\nmay be glorified in the creature, he created it that they might\nrejoice in his glory: for we have shown that they are the same.6\n\nThis was the great coming together for me—the breakthrough.\nWhat was life about? What was it for? Why do I exist? Why am\n6. Jonathan Edwards, “Nothing Upon Earth Can Represent the Glories of Heaven,” in\nSermons and Discourses, 1723–1729, ed. Kenneth P. Minkema, vol. 14 of The Works of\nJonathan Edwards (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1997), 144.\n\n\fBreakthrough—The Beauty of Christ, My Joy\n\n[PAGE 31]\n\nI here? To be happy? Or to glorify God? Unspoken for years,\nthere was in me the feeling that these two were at odds. Either\nyou glorify God or you pursue happiness. One seemed absolutely\nright; the other seemed absolutely inevitable. And that is why I\nwas confused and frustrated for so long.\nCompounding the problem was that many who seemed to emphasize the glory of God in their thinking did not seem to enjoy\nhim much. And many who seemed to enjoy God most were defective in their thinking about his glory. But now here was the greatest mind of early America, Jonathan Edwards, saying that God’s\npurpose for my life was that I have a passion for God’s glory and\nthat I have a passion for my joy in that glory, and that these two\nare one passion.\nWhen I saw this, I knew, at last, what a wasted life would be\nand how to avoid it.\nGod created me—and you—to live with a single, all-embracing,\nall-transforming passion, namely, a passion to glorify God by\nenjoying and displaying his supreme excellence in all the spheres of\nlife. Enjoying and displaying are both crucial. If we try to display\nthe excellence of God without joy in it, we will display a shell of\nhypocrisy and create scorn or legalism. But if we claim to enjoy\nhis excellence and do not display it for others to see and admire,\nwe deceive ourselves, because the mark of God-enthralled joy is to\noverflow and expand by extending itself into the hearts of others.\nThe wasted life is the life without a passion for the supremacy of\nGod in all things for the joy of all peoples.\n\nThe Crystal-Clear Reason for Living\nThe Bible is crystal clear: God created us for his glory. Thus says\nthe Lord, “Bring my sons from afar and my daughters from the\nend of the earth, everyone who is called by my name, whom I\ncreated for my glory” (Isa. 43:6–7). Life is wasted when we do\nnot live for the glory of God. And I mean all of life. It is all for his\nglory. That is why the Bible gets down into the details of eating\n\n[PAGE 32]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\nand drinking. “Whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do\nall to the glory of God” (1 Cor. 10:31). We waste our lives when\nwe do not weave God into our eating and drinking and every other\npart by enjoying and displaying him.\nWhat does it mean to glorify God? It may get a dangerous\ntwist if we are not careful. Glorify is like the word beautify.\nBut beautify usually means “make something more beautiful than it is,” improve its beauty. That is emphatically not\nwhat we mean by glorify in relation to God. God cannot be\nmade more glorious or more beautiful than he is. He cannot\nbe improved, “nor is he served by human hands, as though he\nneeded anything” (Acts 17:25). Glorify does not mean add\nmore glory to God.\nIt is more like the word magnify. But here too we can go\nwrong. Magnify has two distinct meanings. In relation to God,\none is worship and one is wickedness. You can magnify like a\ntelescope or like a microscope. When you magnify like a microscope, you make something tiny look bigger than it is. A dust\nmite can look like a monster. Pretending to magnify God like that\nis wickedness. But when you magnify like a telescope, you make\nsomething unimaginably great look like what it really is. With the\nHubble Space Telescope, pinprick galaxies in the sky are revealed\nfor the billion-star giants that they are. Magnifying God like that\nis worship.\nWe waste our lives when we do not pray and think and dream\nand plan and work toward magnifying God in all spheres of life.\nGod created us for this: to live our lives in a way that makes\nhim look more like the greatness and the beauty and the infinite\nworth that he really is. In the night sky of this world God appears to most people, if at all, like a pinprick of light in a heaven\nof darkness. But he created us and called us to make him look\nlike what he really is. This is what it means to be created in the\nimage of God. We are meant to image forth in the world what\nhe is really like.\n\n\fBreakthrough—The Beauty of Christ, My Joy\n\n[PAGE 33]\n\nDoes Being Loved Mean Being Made Much Of?\nFor many people, this is not obviously an act of love. They do not\nfeel loved when they are told that God created them for his glory.\nThey feel used. This is understandable given the way love has been\nalmost completely distorted in our world. For most people, to be\nloved is to be made much of. Almost everything in our Western\nculture serves this distortion of love. We are taught in a thousand\nways that love means increasing someone’s self-esteem. Love is\nhelping someone feel good about themselves. Love is giving someone a mirror and helping him like what he sees.\nThis is not what the Bible means by the love of God. Love is\ndoing what is best for someone. But making self the object of our\nhighest affections is not best for us. It is, in fact, a lethal distraction. We were made to see and savor God—and savoring him, to\nbe supremely satisfied, and thus spread in all the world the worth\nof his presence. Not to show people the all-satisfying God is not\nto love them. To make them feel good about themselves when they\nwere made to feel good about seeing God is like taking someone\nto the Alps and locking him in a room full of mirrors.\n\nPathological at the Grand Canyon\nThe really wonderful moments of joy in this world are not the moments of self-satisfaction, but self-forgetfulness. Standing on the\nedge of the Grand Canyon and contemplating your own greatness\nis pathological. At such moments we are made for a magnificent\njoy that comes from outside ourselves. And each of these rare and\nprecious moments in life—beside the Canyon, before the Alps,\nunder the stars—is an echo of a far greater excellence, namely, the\nglory of God. That is why the Bible says, “The heavens declare\nthe glory of God, and the sky above proclaims his handiwork”\n(Ps.19:1).\nSometimes people say that they cannot believe that, if there is\na God, he would take interest in such a tiny speck of reality called\nhumanity on planet earth. The universe, they say, is so vast, it\n\n[PAGE 34]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\nmakes man utterly insignificant. Why would God have bothered\nto create such a microscopic speck called the earth and humanity\nand then get involved with us?\nBeneath this question is a fundamental failure to see what\nthe universe is about. It is about the greatness of God, not the\nsignificance of man. God made man small and the universe big\nto say something about himself. And he says it for us to learn\nand enjoy—namely, that he is infinitely great and powerful and\nwise and beautiful. The more the Hubble Telescope sends back to\nus about the unfathomable depths of space, the more we should\nstand in awe of God. The disproportion between us and the universe is a parable about the disproportion between us and God.\nAnd it is an understatement. But the point is not to nullify us but\nto glorify him.\n\nLoving People Means Pointing Them\nto the All-Satisfying God\nNow back to what it means to be loved. The idea has been almost\ntotally distorted. Love has to do with showing a dying soul the\nlife-giving beauty of the glory of God, especially his grace. Yes, as\nwe will see, we show God’s glory in a hundred practical ways that\ninclude care about food and clothes and shelter and health. That’s\nwhat Jesus meant when he said, “Let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your\nFather who is in heaven” (Matt. 5:16).\nEvery good work should be a revelation of the glory of God.\nWhat makes the good deed an act of love is not the raw act,\nbut the passion and the sacrifice to make God himself known as\nglorious. Not to aim to show God is not to love, because God is\nwhat we need most deeply. And to have all else without him is to\nperish in the end. The Bible says that you can give away all that\nyou have and deliver your body to be burned and have not love\n(1 Cor. 13:3). If you don’t point people to God for everlasting joy,\nyou don’t love. You waste your life.\n\n\fBreakthrough—The Beauty of Christ, My Joy\n\n[PAGE 35]\n\nIs Eternal Life a Heaven Full of Mirrors?\nNow think what this means for God’s love. How shall God love us?\nMere logic could give us the answer: God loves us best by giving us\nthe best to enjoy forever, namely, himself, for he is best. But we are\nnot dependent on logic alone. The Bible makes this clear. “For God\nso loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes\nin him should not perish but have eternal life” (John 3:16). God\nloves us by giving us eternal life at the cost of his Son, Jesus Christ.\nBut what is eternal life? Is it eternal self-esteem? Is it a heaven full\nof mirrors? Or snowboards, or golf links, or black-eyed virgins?\nNo. Jesus tells us exactly what he meant: “And this is eternal\nlife, that they know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom\nyou have sent” (John 17:3). What is eternal life? It is to know God\nand his Son, Jesus Christ. No thing can satisfy the soul. The soul\nwas made to stand in awe of a Person—the only person worthy\nof awe. All heroes are shadows of Christ. We love to admire their\nexcellence. How much more will we be satisfied by the one Person\nwho conceived all excellence and embodies all skill, all talent, all\nstrength and brilliance and savvy and goodness. This is what I\nhave been trying to say. God loves us by liberating us from the\nbondage of self so that we can enjoy knowing and admiring him\nforever.\nOr consider the way the apostle Peter says it. “Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might\nbring us to God” (1 Pet. 3:18). Why did God send Jesus Christ\nto die for us? “That he might bring us to God”—to himself. God\nsent Christ to die so that we could come home to the all-satisfying\nFather. This is love. God’s love for us is God’s doing what he must\ndo, at great cost to himself, so that we might have the pleasure of\nseeing and savoring him forever. If it is true, as the Psalmist says to\nGod, “In your presence there is fullness of joy; at your right hand\nare pleasures forevermore” (Ps. 16:11), then what must love do?\nIt must rescue us from our addiction to self and bring us, changed,\ninto the presence of God.\n\n[PAGE 36]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\nAre You Being Used?\nSo here is the question to test whether you have been sucked into\nthis world’s distortion of love: Would you feel more loved by God\nif he made much of you, or if he liberated you from the bondage\nof self-regard, at great cost to himself, so that you enjoy making\nmuch of him forever?\nSuppose you answer, “I want to be free from self and full of\njoy in God; I want to enjoy making much of God, not me. And\nI want the fullness of my joy to last forever.” If you respond this\nway, then you will also have an answer to the fear I mentioned\nearlier, that you are just being used by God when he creates you\nfor his glory. Now we see that in creating us for his glory, he is\ncreating us for our highest joy. He is most glorified in us when we\nare most satisfied in him.\nGod is the one being in the universe for whom self-exaltation\nis the most loving act. Anyone else who exalts himself distracts us\nfrom what we need, namely, God. But if God exalts himself, he\ncalls attention to the very thing we need most for our joy. If great\npaintings could talk, and they saw you walking through the gallery staring at the floor, they would cry out, “Look! Look at me. I\nam the reason you are here.” And when you look and exult in the\nbeauty of the paintings with those around you, your joy would be\nfull. You would not complain that the paintings should have kept\nquiet. They rescued you from wasting your visit. In the same way,\nno child complains, “I am being used,” when his father delights\nto make the child happy with his own presence.\n\nFinally Free to Embrace the Single\nPassion for Which I Was Made\nWith these discoveries I now felt free to affirm God’s purpose for\nmy life revealed in the Bible. I didn’t have to be afraid that I must\nchoose between what is right and what is inevitable—between\npursuing his glory and pursuing my joy. I was free to experience\nthe single passion for God’s supremacy in all things for the joy\n\n\fBreakthrough—The Beauty of Christ, My Joy\n\n[PAGE 37]\n\nof all peoples. I was rescued from the wasted life. Now life could\nhave ultimate meaning—the same meaning God’s life has: enjoying and displaying his greatness.\nI was free to embrace the end of my old quest: the point, the\npurpose, the focus, and the essence of it all. It was real. It was objective. It was there. And it was rooted in the very essence of what\nGod is in himself. He is glorious, beautiful, and magnificent in his\nmanifold perfections. They are infinite, eternal, and unchanging.\nThey are Truth and Justice and Goodness and Wisdom and Power\nand Love. Flowing out from what he is in himself comes the purpose for our existence. God’s passion for his own glory gives birth\nto ours. That is the single, all-embracing, all-transforming reason\nfor being: a passion to enjoy and display God’s supremacy in all\nthings for the joy of all peoples.\nGod created us to live with a single passion to joyfully display\nhis supreme excellence in all the spheres of life. The wasted life is\nthe life without this passion. God calls us to pray and think and\ndream and plan and work not to be made much of, but to make\nmuch of him in every part of our lives.\n\nNow Enters the Glory of Jesus Christ\nSince September 11, 2001, I have seen more clearly than ever how\nessential it is to exult explicitly in the excellence of Christ crucified for sinners and risen from the dead. Christ must be explicit\nin all our God-talk. It will not do, in this day of pluralism, to talk\nabout the glory of God in vague ways. God without Christ is no\nGod. And a no-God cannot save or satisfy the soul. Following a\nno-God—whatever his name or whatever his religion—will be a\nwasted life. God-in-Christ is the only true God and the only path\nto joy. Everything I have said so far must now be related to Christ.\nThe old kitchen plaque comes back: “Only what’s done for Christ\nwill last.”\nTo bring us to this highest and most durable of all pleasures,\nGod made his Son, Jesus Christ, a bloody spectacle of blameless\n\n[PAGE 38]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\nsuffering and death. This is what it cost to rescue us from a wasted\nlife. The eternal Son of God “did not count equality with God a\nthing to be grasped, but made himself nothing.” He took “the\nform of a servant” and was born “in the likeness of men. . . . He\nhumbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even\ndeath on a cross” (Phil. 2:6–8).\n\nAll Things Were Made for Him\nThis Jesus was and is a real historical man in whom “the whole\nfullness of deity dwells bodily” (Col. 2:9). Since he is “God of\nGod, Light of Light, very God of very God,” as the old Nicene\nCreed says, and since his death and resurrection are the central\nact of God in history, it is not surprising to hear the Bible say, “All\nthings were created through him and for him” (Col. 1:16). For\nhim! That means for his glory. Which also means that everything\nwe have said so far about God creating us for his glory also means\nthat he created us for the glory of his Son.\nIn his prayer in John 17 the first thing Jesus asks is, “Father,\nthe hour has come; glorify your Son that the Son may glorify you”\n(John 17:1). Ever since the incarnate, redeeming work of Jesus,\nGod is gladly glorified by sinners only through the glorification\nof the risen God-man, Jesus Christ. His bloody death is the blazing center of the glory of God. There is no way to the glory of\nthe Father but through the Son. All the promises of joy in God’s\npresence, and pleasures at his right hand, come to us only through\nfaith in Jesus Christ.\n\nIf We Reject Him, We Reject God\nJesus is the litmus test of reality for all persons and all religions. He\nsaid it clearly: “The one who rejects me rejects him who sent me”\n(Luke 10:16). People and religions who reject Christ reject God. Do\nother religions know the true God? Here is the test: Do they reject\nJesus as the only Savior for sinners who was crucified and raised by\nGod from the dead? If they do, they do not know God in a saving way.",

No one comes to the Father except through me”\n(John 14:6). Or when he said, “Whoever does not honor the Son\ndoes not honor the Father who sent him” (John 5:23). Or when\nhe said to the Pharisees, “If God were your Father, you would\nlove me” (John 8:42).\nIt’s what the apostle John meant when he said, “No one who\ndenies the Son has the Father. Whoever confesses the Son has the\nFather also” (1 John 2:23). Or when he said, “Everyone who\n. . . does not abide in the teaching of Christ, does not have God”\n(2 John 9).\nThere is no point in romanticizing other religions that reject\nthe deity and saving work of Christ. They do not know God. And\nthose who follow them tragically waste their lives.\nIf we would see and savor the glory of God, we must see and\nsavor Christ. For Christ is “the image of the invisible God” (Col.\n1:15). To put it another way, if we would embrace the glory of\nGod, we must embrace the gospel of Christ. The reason for this is\nnot only because we are sinners and need a Savior to die for us, but\nalso because this Savior is himself the fullest and most beautiful\nmanifestation of the glory of God. He purchases our undeserved\nand everlasting pleasure, and he becomes for us our all-deserving,\neverlasting Treasure.\n\nThe Gospel Is the Good News of the Glory of Christ\nThis is how the gospel is defined. When we are converted through\nfaith in Christ, what we see with the eyes of our hearts is “the\nlight of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God”\n(2 Cor. 4:4). The gospel is the good news of all-conquering beauty.\nOr to say it the way Paul does, it is the good news of “the glory of\nChrist.” When we embrace Christ, we embrace God. We see and\nsavor God’s glory. There is no savoring of God’s glory if we do not\nsee it in Christ. This is the only window through which a sinner\nmay see the face of God and not be incinerated.\n\n[PAGE 40]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\nThe Bible says that when God illuminates our heart at conversion, he gives “the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in\nthe face of Jesus Christ” (2 Cor. 4:6). Either we see the glory of\nGod “in the face of Jesus Christ,” or we don’t see it at all. And the\n“face of Jesus Christ” is the beauty of Christ reaching its climax in\nthe cross. The bloody face of Christ crucified (and triumphant!) is\nthe countenance of the glory of God. What was once foolishness\nto us becomes our wisdom and our power and our boast (1 Cor.\n1:18, 24).\nLife is wasted if we do not grasp the glory of the cross, cherish\nit for the treasure that it is, and cleave to it as the highest price of\nevery pleasure and the deepest comfort in every pain. That is what\nthe next chapter is about.\n\n\f3\n\nBoasting Only in the Cross,\nthe Blazing Center\nof the Glory of God\n\nThe opposite of wasting your life is living life by a single Godexalting, soul-satisfying passion. The well-lived life must be Godexalting and soul-satisfying because that is why God created us\n(Isa. 43:7; Ps. 90:14). That was the burden of chapter 2. And\n“passion” is the right word (or, if you prefer, zeal, fervor, ardor,\nblood-earnestness) because God commands us to love him with\nall our heart (Matt. 22:37), and Jesus reminds us that he spits\nlukewarm people out of his mouth (Rev. 3:16). The opposite of\nwasting your life is to live by a single, soul-satisfying passion for\nthe supremacy of God in all things.\nHow serious is this word “single”? Can life really have that\nmuch “singleness” of purpose? Can work and leisure and relationships and eating and lovemaking and ministry all really flow from\na single passion? Is there something deep enough and big enough\nand strong enough to hold all that together? Can sex and cars and\nwork and war and changing diapers and doing taxes really have\na God-exalting, soul-satisfying unity?\n\n[PAGE 42]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\nThis question drives us to the very same place where we ended\nchapter 2, namely, to the death of Jesus on the cross. We ended\nthere because living for the glory of God must mean living for the\nglory of Christ crucified. Christ is the image of God. He is the sum\nof God’s glory in human form. And his beauty shines most brightly\nat his darkest hour.\n\nPressed by the Bible to Know One Thing\nBut we are driven to the same bloody place also by the question of\na single passion. The Bible pushes us in this direction. For example,\nthe apostle Paul said that his life and ministry were riveted on a single aim: “I decided to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ\nand him crucified” (1 Cor. 2:2). That is astonishing, when you think\nof all the varied things Paul did, in fact, talk about. There must be\na sense in which “Jesus Christ and him crucified” is the ground and\nsum of everything else he says. He is pushing us to see our lives with\na single focus, and for the cross of Christ to be that focus.\nYou don’t have to know a lot of things for your life to make a\nlasting difference in the world. But you do have to know the few\ngreat things that matter, perhaps just one, and then be willing to\nlive for them and die for them. The people that make a durable difference in the world are not the people who have mastered many\nthings, but who have been mastered by one great thing. If you\nwant your life to count, if you want the ripple effect of the pebbles\nyou drop to become waves that reach the ends of the earth and roll\non into eternity, you don’t need to have a high IQ. You don’t have\nto have good looks or riches or come from a fine family or a fine\nschool. Instead you have to know a few great, majestic, unchanging, obvious, simple, glorious things—or one great all-embracing\nthing—and be set on fire by them.\n\nA Tragedy in the Making\nYou may not be sure that you want your life to make a difference.\nMaybe you don’t care very much whether you make a lasting\n\n\fBoasting Only in the Cross, the Blazing Center of the Glory of God 43\n\ndifference for the sake of something great. You just want people\nto like you. If people would just like being around you, you’d be\nsatisfied. Or if you could just have a good job with a good wife, or\nhusband, and a couple of good kids and a nice car and long weekends and a few good friends, a fun retirement, and a quick and\neasy death, and no hell—if you could have all that (even without\nGod)—you would be satisfied. That is a tragedy in the making.\nA wasted life.\n\nThese Lives and Deaths Were No Tragedy\nIn April 2000, Ruby Eliason and Laura Edwards were killed in\nCameroon, West Africa. Ruby was over eighty. Single all her life,\nshe poured it out for one great thing: to make Jesus Christ known\namong the unreached, the poor, and the sick. Laura was a widow,\na medical doctor, pushing eighty years old, and serving at Ruby’s\nside in Cameroon. The brakes failed, the car went over a cliff,\nand they were both killed instantly. I asked my congregation: Was\nthat a tragedy? Two lives, driven by one great passion, namely, to\nbe spent in unheralded service to the perishing poor for the glory\nof Jesus Christ—even two decades after most of their American\ncounterparts had retired to throw away their lives on trifles. No,\nthat is not a tragedy. That is a glory. These lives were not wasted.\nAnd these lives were not lost. “Whoever loses his life for my sake\nand the gospel’s will save it” (Mark 8:35).\n\nAn American Tragedy: How Not to Finish Your One Life\nI will tell you what a tragedy is. I will show you how to waste your\nlife. Consider a story from the February 1998 edition of Reader’s\nDigest, which tells about a couple who “took early retirement\nfrom their jobs in the Northeast five years ago when he was fiftynine and she was fifty-one. Now they live in Punta Gorda, Florida,\nwhere they cruise on their 30-foot trawler, play softball, and collect shells.” At first, when I read it I thought it might be a joke.\nA spoof on the American Dream. But it wasn’t. Tragically, this\n\n[PAGE 44]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\nwas the dream: come to the end of your life—your one and only\nprecious, God-given life—and let the last great work of your life,\nbefore you give an account to your Creator, be this: playing softball and collecting shells. Picture them before Christ at the great\nday of judgment: “Look, Lord. See my shells.” That is a tragedy.\nAnd people today are spending billions of dollars to persuade you\nto embrace that tragic dream. Over against that, I put my protest:\nDon’t buy it. Don’t waste your life.\n\nPretend I Am Your Father\nAs I write this, I am now in my sixties. As the months go by, I\nrelate to more and more people who are young enough to be my\nsons and daughters. You may be in that category. I have four sons\nand one daughter. Few things, if any, fill me with more longing\nthese months and years than the longing that my children not\nwaste their lives on fatal success.\nThis longing transfers very easily to you, especially if you\nare in your twenties or thirties. I see you, as it were, like a son\nor a daughter, and in these pages I plead with you as a father—\nperhaps a father who loves you dearly, or the father you never\nhad. Or the father who never had a vision for you like I have for\nyou—and God has for you. Or the father who has a vision for\nyou, but it’s all about money and status. I look through these\npages and see you as sons and daughters, and I plead with you:\nDesire that your life count for something great! Long for your\nlife to have eternal significance. Want this! Don’t coast through\nlife without a passion.\n\nI Love the Vision of Louie Giglio\nOne of the inspirations behind this book was my participation in the conferences for college students and young adults\ncalled Passion ’97, Passion ’98, Passion ’99, OneDay (2002),\nand OneDay03. Under Christ, the spark plug behind these worship and mission-mobilizing gatherings was Louie Giglio. He is\n\n\fBoasting Only in the Cross, the Blazing Center of the Glory of God 45\n\ncalling young people to make a “268 Declaration.” The number\ncomes from Isaiah 26:8—“Yes, Lord, walking in the way of\nyour laws, we wait for you; your name and renown are the\ndesire of our hearts” (NIV). The first statement of the “Declaration” says, “Because I was created by God and for His glory,\nI will magnify Him as I respond to His great love. My desire\nis to make knowing and enjoying God the passionate pursuit\nof my life.”1\nThis vision of life holds out to students and young adults so\nmuch more than the emptiness of mere success or the orgy of\nspring break. Here is not just a body, but a soul. Not just a soul,\nbut a soul with a passion and a desire. Not just a desire for being\nliked or for playing softball or collecting shells. Here is a desire\nfor something infinitely great and beautiful and valuable and\nsatisfying—the name and the glory of God—“Your name and\nrenown are the desire of our hearts.”\nThis accords with everything I wrote in the last chapter and\napplies it to the upcoming generation. This is what I live to know\nand long to experience. This is virtually the mission statement\nof my life and the church I serve: “We exist to spread a passion\nfor the supremacy of God in all things for the joy of all peoples\nthrough Jesus Christ.” You don’t have to say it like I say it or like\nLouie Giglio says it. But whatever you do, find the God-centered,\nChrist-exalting, Bible-saturated passion of your life, and find your\nway to say it and live for it and die for it. And you will make a\ndifference that lasts. You will not waste your life.\n\nThe Man Whose Single Passion Made All Else Rubbish\nYou will be like the apostle Paul, as we saw earlier, when he said\nthat he wanted to know nothing but Jesus Christ and him crucified. Nobody had a more single-minded vision for his life than\nPaul did. He could say it in many different ways. He could say:\n1. See http://www.268generation.com/#!declaration.\n\n[PAGE 46]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\n“I do not account my life of any value nor as precious to myself, if\nonly I may finish my course and the ministry that I received from\nthe Lord Jesus, to testify to the gospel of the grace of God” (Acts\n20:24). One thing mattered: “I will not waste my life! I will finish\nmy course and finish it well. I will display the gospel of the grace\nof God in all I do. I will run my race to the end.”\nOr he could say, “Whatever gain I had, I counted as loss for\nthe sake of Christ. Indeed, I count everything as loss because of\nthe surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his\nsake I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as rubbish, in order that I may gain Christ” (Phil. 3:7–8). One thing\nmatters: Know Christ, and gain Christ. Everything is rubbish in\ncomparison to this.\nWhat is the one passion of your life that makes everything else\nlook like rubbish in comparison? Oh, that God would help me\nwaken in you a single passion for a single great reality that would\nunleash you, and set you free from small dreams, and send you,\nfor the glory of Christ, into all the spheres of secular life and to\nall the peoples of the earth.\n\nChrist Crucified, the Blazing Center of the Glory of God\nWith a prayer to that end, I take up again where I left off in the\nlast chapter. There I said, “Life is wasted if we do not grasp the\nglory of the cross, cherish it for the treasure that it is, and cleave\nto it as the highest price of every pleasure and the deepest comfort in every pain.” What was once foolishness to us—a crucified\nGod—must become our wisdom and our power and our only\nboast in this world.\nI argued in chapter 2 that God created us to live for his glory,\nand that God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied\nin him. We magnify God’s worth the most when he becomes our\nonly boast. And I concluded that chapter with a claim that his\nglory can only be seen and savored by sinners through the glory\nof Jesus Christ. Any other approach to God is illusion or incin-\n\n\fBoasting Only in the Cross, the Blazing Center of the Glory of God 47\n\neration. If we would make much of God, we must make much of\nChrist. His bloody death is the blazing center of the glory of God.\nIf God is to be our boast, what he did and what he is in Christ\nmust be our boast.\n\nThe Shocking Summons to Boast in a Lynching Rope\nIn this regard, few verses in the Bible are more radical and sweeping and Christ-exalting than Galatians 6:14: “Far be it from me\nto boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by which\nthe world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.” Or to\nstate it positively: Only boast in the cross of Jesus Christ. This is\na single idea. A single goal for life. A single passion. Only boast\nin the cross. The word “boast” can be translated “exult in” or\n“rejoice in.” Only exult in the cross of Christ. Only rejoice in the\ncross of Christ. Paul says: let this be your single passion, your\nsingle boast and joy and exultation. If you understand me—and\nI hope you will before we are done—you will know why it does\nnot contradict but confirms all I have written in chapter 2 when\nI pray for you, the reader, May the one thing that you cherish,\nthe one thing that you rejoice in and exult over, be the cross of\nJesus Christ.\nFor Paul to say that we should boast only in the cross of Christ\nis shocking for two reasons.\nOne is that it’s like saying: Boast only in the electric chair. Only\nexult in the gas chamber. Only rejoice in the lethal injection. Let\nyour one boast and one joy and one exultation be the lynching\nrope. “May it never be that I would boast, except in the cross of\nour Lord Jesus Christ.” No manner of execution that has ever\nbeen devised was more cruel and agonizing than to be nailed to a\ncross and hung up to die like a piece of meat. It was horrible. You\nwould not have been able to watch it—not without screaming and\npulling at your hair and tearing your clothes. You probably would\nhave vomited. Let this, Paul says, be the one passion of your life.\nThat is one thing that is shocking about his words.\n\n[PAGE 48]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\nThe other is that he says this is to be the only boast of your\nlife. The only joy. The only exultation. “Far be it from me to boast\nexcept in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by which the world\nhas been crucified to me, and I to the world.” What does he mean\nby this? Can he be serious? No other boast? No other exultation?\nNo other joy except the cross of Jesus?\nWhat about the places where Paul himself uses the same word\nto talk about boasting or exulting in other things? For example,\nRomans 5:2: “We rejoice in hope of the glory of God.” Romans\n5:3–4: “Not only that, but we rejoice in our sufferings, knowing\nthat suffering produces endurance, and endurance produces character, and character produces hope.” Second Corinthians 12:9:\n“I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the\npower of Christ may rest upon me.” First Thessalonians 2:19:\n“What is our hope or joy or crown of boasting before our Lord\nJesus at his coming? Is it not you?”\n\n“Boast Only in This” Means “Let All\nBoasting Be Boasting in This”\nSo, if Paul can boast and exult and rejoice in all these things, what\ndoes Paul mean—that he would not “boast except in the cross of\nour Lord Jesus Christ” (Gal. 6:14)? Is that just double-talk? You\nexult in one thing, but say that you are exulting in another thing?\nNo. There is a very profound reason for saying that all exultation,\nall rejoicing, all boasting in anything should be a rejoicing in the\ncross of Jesus Christ.\nPaul means something that will change every part of your life.\nHe means that, for the Christian, all other boasting should also\nbe a boasting in the cross. All exultation in anything else should\nbe exultation in the cross. If you exult in the hope of glory, you\nshould be exulting in the cross of Christ. If you exult in tribulation because tribulation works hope, you should be exulting in the\ncross of Christ. If you exult in your weaknesses, or in the people\nof God, you should be exulting in the cross of Christ.\n\n\fBoasting Only in the Cross, the Blazing Center of the Glory of God 49\n\nChrist Bought Every Good Thing and Every\nBad Thing That Turned for Good\nWhy is this the case? Because for redeemed sinners, every good\nthing—indeed every bad thing that God turns for good—was obtained for us by the cross of Christ. Apart from the death of Christ,\nsinners get nothing but judgment. Apart from the cross of Christ,\nthere is only condemnation. Therefore everything that you enjoy in\nChrist—as a Christian, as a person who trusts Christ—is owing to the\ndeath of Christ. And all your rejoicing in all things should therefore\nbe a rejoicing in the cross where all your blessings were purchased for\nyou at the cost of the death of the Son of God, Jesus Christ.\nOne of the reasons we are not as Christ-centered and crosssaturated as we should be is that we have not realized that\neverything—everything good and everything bad that God turns for\nthe good of his redeemed children—was purchased by the death of\nChrist for us. We simply take life and breath and health and friends\nand everything for granted. We think it is ours by right. But the fact\nis that it is not ours by right. We are doubly undeserving of it.\n(1) We are creatures, and our Creator is not bound or obligated\nto give us anything—not life or health or anything. He gives, he\ntakes, and he does us no injustice (Job 1:21).\n(2) And besides being creatures with no claim on our Creator,\nwe are sinners. We have fallen short of his glory (Rom. 3:23). We\nhave ignored him and disobeyed him and failed to love him and\ntrust him. The wrath of his justice is kindled against us. All we\ndeserve from him is judgment (Rom. 3:19). Therefore every breath\nwe take, every time our heart beats, every day that the sun rises,\nevery moment we see with our eyes or hear with our ears or speak\nwith our mouths or walk with our legs is, for now, a free and undeserved gift to sinners who deserve only judgment.\n\nWelcomed Mercy or Mounting Wrath?\nI say “for now” because if you refuse to see God in his gifts, they\nwill turn out not to be gifts but High Court evidence of ingratitude.\n\n[PAGE 50]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\nThe Bible speaks of them first as “the riches of his kindness and\nforbearance and patience” that point us to repentance (Rom. 2:4).\nBut when we presume upon them and do not cherish God’s grace\nin them, “Because of your hard and impenitent heart you are\nstoring up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath when God’s\nrighteous judgment will be revealed” (Rom. 2:5).\nBut for those who see the merciful hand of God in every breath\nthey take and give credit where it is due, Jesus Christ will be seen\nand savored as the great Purchaser of every undeserved breath.\nEvery heartbeat will be received as a gift from his hand.\n\nDeserving Nothing but Inheriting Everything—Why?\nHow then did he purchase them? Answer: by his blood. If I deserve\nnothing but condemnation because of my sin, but instead get life\nand breath in this age, and everlasting joy in the age to come because Christ died for me, then everything good—and everything bad\nthat God turns for good—must be the reward of his suffering (not\nmy merit). This includes all that diversity that I wondered about\nat the beginning of this chapter. I asked: Can work and leisure and\nrelationships and eating and lovemaking and ministry all really\nflow from a single passion? Is there something deep enough and big\nenough and strong enough to hold all that together? Can sex and\ncars and work and war and changing diapers and doing taxes really\nhave a God-exalting, soul-satisfying unity? Now we see that every\nexperience in life is designed to magnify the cross of Christ. Or to\nsay it another way, every good thing in life (or bad thing graciously\nturned for good) is meant to magnify Christ and him crucified.\n\nDid Christ Buy My Totaled Dodge?\nSo, for example, we totaled our old Dodge Spirit several years ago,\nbut nobody was hurt. And in that safety I exult. I glory in that.\nBut why was nobody hurt? That was a gift to me and my family\nthat none of us deserves. And it won’t always be that way. But this\ntime it was, and we didn’t deserve it. We are sinners and by nature\n\n\fBoasting Only in the Cross, the Blazing Center of the Glory of God 51\n\nchildren of wrath, apart from Christ. So how did we come to have\nsuch a gift for our good? Answer: Christ died for our sins on the\ncross and took away the wrath of God from us and secured for\nus, even though we don’t deserve it, God’s omnipotent grace that\nworks everything together for our good. So when I exult in our\nsafety, I am exulting in the cross of Christ.\nThen the insurance paid us for the car, and my wife Noël took\nthat money and went to Iowa and bought a Chevy Lumina that\nwas one year newer and drove it home in the snow. And I exult in\nthe amazing grace of so much bounty. Just like that. You wreck\nyour car. You come out unhurt. Insurance pays up. You get another\none. And you move on almost as if nothing had happened. And\nin thanks I bow my head and exult in the untold mercies even of\nthese little material things. Where do all these mercies come from?\nIf you are a saved sinner, a believer in Jesus, they come through the\ncross. Apart from the cross, there is only judgment—patience and\nmercy for a season, but then, if spurned, all that mercy only serves\nto intensify judgment. Therefore every good thing in life, and every\nbad thing that God turns for good, is a blood-bought gift. And all\nboasting—all exultation—should be boasting in the cross.\nWoe to me if I exult in any blessing of any kind at any time,\nunless my exulting is an exulting in the cross of Christ.\nAnother way to say this is that the design of the cross is the\nglory of Christ. The aim of God in the cross is that Christ would\nbe honored. When Paul says in Galatians 6:14, “Far be it from\nme to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ,” he is\nsaying that God’s will is that the cross always be magnified—that\nChrist crucified always be our boast and exultation and joy and\npraise—that Christ get glory and thanks and honor for every good\nthing in our lives and every bad thing that God turns for good.\n\nSpreading a Passion for Christ Crucified—by Teaching\nBut now here’s a question: If that is the aim of God in the death of\nChrist—namely, that “Christ crucified” be honored and glorified\n\n[PAGE 52]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\nfor all things—then how is Christ to get the glory he deserves? The\nanswer is that this generation has to be taught that these things are\nso. Or to say it another way: the source of exultation in the cross\nof Christ is education about the cross of Christ.\nThat’s my job. I am not alone, but I do embrace it for myself\nwith a passion. This is what I believe the Lord called me to in 1966\nwhen I lay sick with mono in the health center in Wheaton, Illinois. This is where it was all leading—God’s mandate: So live and\nso study and so serve and so preach and so write that Jesus Christ,\nthe crucified and risen God, be the only boast of this generation.\nAnd if this is my job, yours is the same, just in a different form: to\nlive and speak in such a way that the worth of “Christ crucified”\nis seen and savored by more and more people. It will be costly for\nus as it was for him.\n\nThe Only Place to Boast in the Cross Is on the Cross\nIf we desire that there be no boasting except in the cross, then we\nmust live near the cross—indeed we must live on the cross. This\nis shocking. But this is what Galatians 6:14 says: “Far be it from\nme to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by which\nthe world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.” Boasting\nin the cross happens when you are on the cross. Is that not what\nPaul says? “The world has been crucified to me, and I [have been\ncrucified] to the world.” The world is dead to me, and I am dead to\nthe world. Why? Because I have been crucified. We learn to boast\nin the cross and exult in the cross when we are on the cross. And\nuntil our selves are crucified there, our boast will be in ourselves.\nBut what does this mean? When did this happen? When were\nwe crucified? The Bible gives the answer in Galatians 2:20: “I have\nbeen crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ\nwho lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith\nin the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.” When\nChrist died, we died. The glorious meaning of the death of Christ\nis that when he died, all those who are his died in him. The death\n\n\fBoasting Only in the Cross, the Blazing Center of the Glory of God 53\n\nthat he died for us all becomes our death when we are united to\nChrist by faith (Rom. 6:5).\nBut you say, “Aren’t I alive? I feel alive.” Well, here is a need\nfor education. We must learn what happened to us. We must be\ntaught these things. That is why Galatians 2:20 and Galatians\n6:14 are in the Bible. God is teaching us what happened to us, so\nthat we can know ourselves, and know his way of working with\nus, and exult in him and in his Son and in the cross as we ought.\n\nLinking with the Death and Life of Christ Crucified\nConsider Galatians 2:20 again. We will see that, yes, we are dead\nand, yes, we are alive. “I have been crucified with Christ [so I am\ndead]. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. And\nthe life I now live in the flesh [so, yes, I am alive, but it isn’t the\nsame “I” as the “I” who died] I live by faith in the Son of God,\nwho loved me and gave himself for me.” In other words, the “I”\nwho lives is the new “I” of faith. The new creation lives. The believer lives. The old self died on the cross with Jesus.\nYou may ask, “What’s the key for linking up with this reality? How can this be mine? How can I be among the dead who\nare alive with Christ and who see and savor and spread the glory\nof the cross?” The answer is implied in the words about faith in\nGalatians 2:20. “The life I now live . . . I live by faith in the Son\nof God.” That is the link. God links you to his Son by faith. And\nwhen he does, there is a union with the Son of God so that his\ndeath becomes your death and his life becomes your life.\n\nDying, Living, and Boasting in the Cross\nNow let’s take all that over to Galatians 6:14, and we will see how\nwe come to live totally for the glory of Christ crucified. “Far be\nit from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ,\nby which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.”\nThat is, don’t boast in anything except in the cross. How shall\nwe become so radically cross-exalting? How can we become the\n\n[PAGE 54]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\nkind of people who trace all our joy back to joy in Christ and him\ncrucified? Answer: The old self that loves to boast and exult and\nrejoice in other things died. By faith we are united to Christ. His\ndeath becomes the death of our self-exalting life. We are raised\nwith him to newness of life. What lives is a new creature whose\nsingle passion is to exalt Christ and his cross.\nTo put it another way, when you put your trust in Christ, your\nbondage to the world and its overpowering lure is broken. You are\na corpse to the world, and the world is a corpse to you. Or to put\nit positively, according to verse 15, you are a “new creation.” The\nold “you” is dead. A new “you” is alive. And the new you is the\nyou of faith. And what faith does is boast not in the world, but in\nChrist, especially Christ crucified.\nThis is how you become so cross-centered that you say with\nPaul, “I will not boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus\nChrist.” The world is no longer our treasure. It’s not the source of\nour life or our satisfaction or our joy. Christ is.\n\nShall We Prize What He Presents or\nWhat It Portrays of Him?\nBut what about safety in the car accident? What about the insurance payment we received? Didn’t I say I was happy about that?\nIsn’t that worldly? So am I really dead to the world? Dead to\ninsurance payments and new cars?\nI pray that I am dead in the right way. I believe that I am. Not\nperfectly, I am sure, but in a real sense. How can this be? If I feel\nglad about safety or health or any good thing, and if these things\nare things of the world (which they are), then am I dead to the\nworld? Yes, because being dead to the world does not mean having no feelings about the world (see 1 John 2:15; 1 Tim. 4:3). It\nmeans that every legitimate pleasure in the world becomes a bloodbought evidence of Christ’s love, and an occasion of boasting in\nthe cross. We are dead to insurance payments when the money is\nnot what satisfies, but Christ crucified, the Giver, satisfies.",

Lewis illustrates what I mean by an experience he had in\na toolshed.\nI was standing today in the dark toolshed. The sun was shining outside and through the crack at the top of the door there\ncame a sunbeam. From where I stood that beam of light, with\nthe specks of dust floating in it, was the most striking thing\nin the place. Everything else was almost pitch-black. I was\nseeing the beam, not seeing things by it.\nThen I moved, so that the beam fell on my eyes. Instantly\nthe whole previous picture vanished. I saw no toolshed, and\n(above all) no beam. Instead I saw, framed in the irregular\ncranny at the top of the door, green leaves moving on the\nbranches of a tree outside and beyond that, ninety-odd million\nmiles away, the sun. Looking along the beam, and looking at\nthe beam are very different experiences.2\n\nThe sunbeams of blessing in our lives are bright in and of themselves. They also give light to the ground where we walk. But\nthere is a higher purpose for these blessings. God means for us to\ndo more than stand outside them and admire them for what they\nare. Even more, he means for us to walk into them and see the sun\nfrom which they come. If the beams are beautiful, the sun is even\nmore beautiful. God’s aim is not that we merely admire his gifts,\nbut, even more, his glory.\n\nWe Die to the Innocent World in the\nBlaze of Christ’s Glory\nNow the point is that the glory of Christ, manifest especially in\nhis death and resurrection, is the glory above and behind every\nblessing we enjoy. He purchased everything that is good for us. His\nglory is where the quest of our affections must end. Everything else\nis a pointer—a parable of this beauty. When our hearts run back\n2. C. S.

Christ is the glory of God. His bloodsoaked cross is the blazing center of that glory. By it he bought\nfor us every blessing—temporal and eternal. And we don’t deserve\nany. He bought them all. Because of Christ’s cross, God’s elect are\ndestined to be sons of God. Because of his cross, the wrath of God\nis taken away. Because of his cross all guilt is removed, and sins\nare forgiven, and perfect righteousness is imputed to us, and the\nlove of God is poured out in our hearts by the Spirit, and we are\nbeing conformed to the image of Christ.\nTherefore every enjoyment in this life and the next that is not\nidolatry is a tribute to the infinite value of the cross of Christ—the\nburning center of the glory of God. And thus a cross-centered,\ncross-exalting, cross-saturated life is a God-glorifying life—the\nonly God-glorifying life. All others are wasted.\n\n\f4\n\nMagnifying Christ through\nPain and Death\n\nLiving to magnify Christ is costly. This is not surprising. He was\ncrucified. He was treated like a devil. And he calls us to follow\nhim. “If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and\ntake up his cross and follow me” (Mark 8:34). He says it will\nprobably not go better for us than for him. “If they have called the\nmaster of the house Beelzebul,1 how much more will they malign\nthose of his household” (Matt. 10:25).\nBut suffering with Jesus on the Calvary road of love is not\nmerely the result of magnifying Christ; it is also the means. He\nis made supreme when we are so satisfied in him that we can\n“let goods and kindred go, this mortal life also” and suffer for\nthe sake of love. His beauty shines most brightly when treasured\nabove health and wealth and life itself. Jesus knew this. He knew\nthat suffering (whether small discomforts or dreadful torture)\nwould be the path in this age for making him most visibly supreme. That is why he calls us to this. He loves us. And love\ndoes not mean making much of us or making life easy. It means\n1. In the time of Christ this was the name for the prince of demons—that is, Satan or\nthe Devil.\n\n[PAGE 58]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\nmaking us able to enjoy making much of him forever—no matter\nwhat it costs.\n\nWe Boast Best in the Cross When We Bear It\nAnd it costs us dearly. The normal Christian life is one that boasts\nonly in the cross—the blazing center of God’s glory—and does it\nwhile bearing the cross. “Whoever does not bear his own cross\nand come after me cannot be my disciple” (Luke 14:27). Bearing\nthe cross is the means by which we are increasingly liberated to\nboast in the cross. Suffering is God’s design in this sin-soaked\nworld (Rom. 8:20). It portrays sin’s horror for the world to see.\nIt punishes sin’s guilt for those who do not believe in Christ. It\nbreaks sin’s power for those who take up their crosses and follow\nJesus. And because sin is the belittling of the all-satisfying glory of\nGod, the suffering that breaks its power is a severe mercy.\nWhatever makes us more and more able to enjoy making much\nof God is a mercy. For there is no greater joy than joy in the greatness of God. And if we must suffer to see this and savor it most\ndeeply, then suffering is a mercy. And Christ’s call to take up our\ncross and join him on the Calvary road is love.\n\nBonhoeffer’s Radical Book for My Generation\nDietrich Bonhoeffer was a gift to my generation of students. I\npray that his costly message will be rediscovered in each generation. Even though he died at the age of thirty-nine, his life was\nnot wasted. His life and death continue to speak with power. He\nwas hanged in the concentration camp at Flossenbürg, Germany,\non April 9, 1945. He had been a pastor and teacher and leader\nof a small training school for the confessing church and had participated in the Protestant resistance movement against the Nazis.\nThe book that set fire to the faith of thousands in my generation was called The Cost of Discipleship. I read it on Christmas\nbreak during my senior year in college. Probably the most famous\nand life-shaping sentence in the book was, “The cross is not the\n\n\fMagnifying Christ through Pain and Death 59\n\nterrible end to an otherwise God-fearing and happy life, but it\nmeets us at the beginning of our communion with Christ. When\nChrist calls a man, he bids him come and die.”2 Fleeing from death\nis the shortest path to a wasted life.\nBonhoeffer’s book was a massive indictment of the “cheap\ngrace” that he saw in the Christian church on both sides of the\nAtlantic. He believed in justification by grace through faith. But he\ndid not believe that the faith that justifies could ever leave people\nunchanged by the radical Christ they claim to believe. That was a\ncheap response to the gospel. “The only man,” he said, “who has\nthe right to say that he is justified by grace alone is the man who\nhas left all to follow Christ.”3\n\nThe Christ-Exalting Paradoxes of Life\nA life devoted to making much of Christ is costly. And the cost is\nboth a consequence and a means of making much of him. If we do\nnot embrace the path of joy-laden, painful love, we will waste our\nlives. If we do not learn with Paul the Christ-exalting paradoxes\nof life, we will squander our days pursuing bubbles that burst.\nHe lived “as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making\nmany rich; as having nothing, yet possessing everything” (2 Cor.\n6:10). The Calvary road is costly and painful, but it is not joyless.\nWhen we embrace with joy the cost of following Christ, his\nworth will shine in the world. The cost itself will become a means\nof making Christ look great. The apostle Paul had one great passion in life. We have seen him say it several ways: to know nothing but Christ and him crucified (1 Cor. 2:2); to boast only in the\ncross (Gal. 6:14).\n\nPaul’s Single Passion in Life and Death\nHe talked about his great passion another way that shows us how\nthe cost of making much of Christ is also the means. He said to the\n2. Dietrich Bonhoeffer, The Cost of Discipleship (New York: Macmillan, 1967), 99.\n3. Ibid., 55.\n\n[PAGE 60]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\nPhilippian church, “It is my eager expectation and hope that I will\nnot be at all ashamed, but that with full courage now as always\nChrist will be honored in my body, whether by life or by death.\nFor to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain” (Phil. 1:20–21). Here\nthe question is raised and answered: How do you honor Christ\nby death? How can the cost of losing everything in this world be\na means of making much of Jesus? Let’s listen carefully to Paul.\nChrist has called us to live for his glory and to die for his glory.\nIf we know how to die well, we will know how to live well. This\ntext shows both.\nAgain we see Paul’s single passion in life: “that . . . Christ will\nbe honored in my body, whether by life or by death.” If Christ is\nnot made much of in our lives, they are wasted. We exist to make\nhim appear in the world as what he really is—magnificent. If our\nlife and death do not show the worth and wonder of Jesus, they\nare wasted. This is why Paul said that his aim in life and death was\n“that . . . Christ . . . be honored.”\n\nOur Shame and Our Treasure\nNotice the unusual way he makes this clear in verse 20: “It is my\neager expectation and hope that I will not be at all ashamed.”\nStop here just a moment. Shame is that horrible feeling of guilt or\nfailure when you don’t measure up before people whose approval\nyou want very much. It’s what the little child feels in the Christmas\nprogram when he forgets his lines, and the tears well up, and the\nsilence seems eternal, and the other kids snicker brutally. I remember these horrible times. Or shame is what a president feels when\nthe secret tapes are finally played, and the foul language and all\nthe deceit emerges, and he stands disgraced and guilty before the\npeople.\nWhat then is the opposite of shame? It’s when the child remembers the lines and hears the applause. It’s when the president\ngoverns well and is reelected. The opposite of being shamed is\nbeing honored. Yes, usually. But Paul was a very unusual person.\n\n\fMagnifying Christ through Pain and Death 61\n\nAnd Christians ought to be very unusual people. For Paul, the\nopposite of being shamed was not his being honored, but Christ’s\nbeing honored through him. “It is my eager expectation and hope\nthat I will not be at all ashamed, but that . . . Christ will be honored in my body.”\nWhat you love determines what you feel shame about. If you\nlove for men to make much of you, you will feel shame when they\ndon’t. But if you love for men to make much of Christ, then you\nwill feel shame if he is belittled on your account. And Paul loved\nChrist more than he loved anything or anyone. “Whatever gain I\nhad, I counted as loss for the sake of Christ. Indeed, I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ\nJesus my Lord” (Phil. 3:7–8).\nWhenever something is of tremendous value to you, and you\ncherish its beauty or power or uniqueness, you want to draw others’ attention to it and waken in them the same joy. That is why\nPaul’s all-consuming goal in life was for Christ to be magnified.\nChrist was of infinite value to Paul, and so Paul longed for others to see and savor this value. That is what it means to magnify\nChrist—to show the magnitude of his value.\n\nDoesn’t Death Make Magnifying God Impossible?\nBut what if someone objected to Paul at this point and said, “Paul,\nwe see how valuable Christ is to you now—how you enjoy his fellowship, how he gives you a fruitful ministry and delivers your life\nfrom spiritual shipwreck. But what will all that mean in the hour\nof death? Where is the value of Christ then? If being a Christian\ncosts you your life, how will that help you make much of Christ?\nWon’t that rob you of the very life that can magnify him?”\nSo Paul adds at the end of verse 20 that his eager expectation is that “Christ will be honored in my body, whether by\nlife or by death” (Phil. 1:20). Death is a threat to the degree\nthat it frustrates your main goals. Death is fearful to the degree\nthat it threatens to rob you of what you treasure most. But Paul\n\n[PAGE 62]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\ntreasured Christ most, and his goal was to magnify Christ. And\nhe saw death not as a frustration of that goal but as an occasion\nfor its fulfillment.\nLife and death! They seem like complete opposites—at great\nenmity with each other. But for Paul—and for all who share his\nfaith—there is a unity, because the same great passion is fulfilled\nin both—namely, that Christ be magnified in this body—our\nbodies—whether by life or by death.\nIn Philippians 1:21, Paul gives a packed summary statement\nexplaining how he is so hopeful that Christ will be magnified in\nhis living and in his dying: “For to me to live is Christ, and to die\nis gain.” Then in verses 22–26 Paul explains both halves of this\nstatement so we can see in more detail how Christ is magnified by\nlife and by death.\nLet’s take these one at a time.\n\nPaul’s Discovery of Peter’s Secret\nFirst, “For me . . . to die is gain.” I wonder if Paul in his conversations with Peter in Jerusalem had talked about dying? I wonder if Peter told him about that experience recorded in John 21\nwhen Jesus, after his resurrection, said to Peter, “When you were\nyoung, you used to dress yourself and walk wherever you wanted,\nbut when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will dress you and carry you where you do not want to go”\n(John 21:18). Then John adds this explanation in his gospel: “This\n[Jesus] said to show by what kind of death [Peter] was to glorify\nGod” (John 21:19). God had decreed that Peter would make God\nlook great in his dying. I don’t doubt that when Peter and Paul\ngave each other the right hand of fellowship, the manly grip of\ntheir hands and the meeting of their eyes communicated this one\ncommon passion: to magnify Christ crucified—the blazing center\nof the glory of God—even in death.\nBut how are we to magnify Christ in death? Or to put it another way: How can we die so that in our dying the surpass-\n\n\fMagnifying Christ through Pain and Death 63\n\ning value of Christ, the magnitude of his worth, becomes visible?\nPaul’s answer here in Philippians 1 is found first in the connection\nbetween verse 20 and verse 21. These verses are connected by the\nword “for” or “because.” Boil it down to the words about death:\n“My eager expectation is that Christ be honored in my body by\ndeath, for to me to die is gain.” In other words, if you experience\ndeath as gain, you magnify Christ in death.\n\nHow Is Dying Gain?\nWhy is that? Verse 23 shows why dying is gain for Paul: “My desire is to depart [that is, to die] and be with Christ, for that is far\nbetter.” That is what death does: it takes us into more intimacy\nwith Christ. We depart, and we are with Christ, and that, Paul\nsays, is gain. And when you experience death this way, Paul says,\nyou exalt Christ. Experiencing Christ as gain in your dying magnifies Christ. It is “far better” than living here.\nReally? Better than all the friends at school? Better than\nfalling in love? Better than hugging your children? Better than\nprofessional success? Better than retirement and grandchildren?\nYes. A thousand times better. When I preached my candidating\nsermon for the pastoral position I hold now, this passage of\nScripture was my text. That was January 27, 1980. I wanted\nto show the people from Scripture the single, all-embracing\npassion of my life—to magnify Christ in all things whether by\nlife or death.\nAt this point in the message, the question arose: Is death better\nthan life? Is departing to be with Christ better than staying here?\nI said to them,\nIf I didn’t believe that, how could I dare to aspire to the\nrole of pastor—anywhere—not to mention at Bethlehem\nBaptist Church where 108 members are over eighty years\nold and another 171 over sixty-five? But I do believe it, and\nsay to every gray-haired believer in this church, with all the\nauthority of Christ’s apostle, the best is yet to come! And\n\n[PAGE 64]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\nI don’t mean a fat pension and a luxury condominium. I\nmean Christ.4\n\nI averaged one funeral every three weeks for the first year and\na half of my ministry. And many more after that. It was a sobering and sweetening season for a young pastor. It knit my heart\ntogether with many families as we bade farewell to friend after\nfriend. And faring well is exactly what we believed they did.\n\nIf We Learn to Die Well, We Will Live Well\nWhat we have learned from Philippians 1 so far is that death\n(whether by natural causes or by persecution) is a means of making much of Christ. If we suffer or die on the Calvary road of\nobedience with Christ, the cost of following him is not just a\nresult of making much of him, but a means. Death makes visible\nwhere our treasure is. The way we die reveals the worth of Christ\nin our hearts. Christ is magnified in my death when I am satisfied\nwith him in my dying—when I experience death as gain because\nI gain him. Or to say it another way: the essence of praising\nChrist is prizing Christ. Christ will be praised in my death, if in\nmy death he is prized above life.\nJesus said, “Whoever loves father or mother more than me is\nnot worthy of me, and whoever loves son or daughter more than\nme is not worthy of me” (Matt. 10:37). When the hour comes for\neverything to be taken from us but Christ, we will magnify him\nby saying, “In him I have everything and more. To die is gain.”\nIf we learn to die like this, we will be ready to live. And if we\ndon’t, we will waste our lives. Most of us have some years to live\nbefore we go to be with Christ. Even the oldest among us must\nask the question, “If we love Christ, how can he be magnified in\nmy behavior this afternoon, this evening, this week?” So we turn\nto the other half of Philippians 1:21: “To me to live is Christ.”\n4. This sermon is available online at www.desiringGod.org under “John Piper’s Candidate Sermon at Bethlehem Baptist Church” (January 27, 1980).\n\n\fMagnifying Christ through Pain and Death 65\n\nTo Live Is Christ\nWhat does Paul mean: “To live is Christ”? He begins his explanation in verse 22: “If I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful\nlabor for me.” But that is a strange explanation: “To live is Christ”\nbecomes “To live is fruitful labor for me.” What is the fruit that\ncomes from Paul’s work? And how is “to live . . . Christ”? The\nanswers come in verses 24–26.\nIn verse 22 Paul has said, “If I am to live in the flesh, that\nmeans fruitful labor for me. Yet which I shall choose I cannot tell.”\nNow in verse 24 he says, “To remain in the flesh is more necessary\non your account.” So evidently the fruit that Paul’s life produces\nis not only for himself but is very needful for the sake of the Philippian believers. So the phrase, “For me to live is Christ” now\nbecomes “For me to live is to produce fruit that you all need very\nmuch.” Then verse 25 tells us what this fruit is that the church\nneeds and that Paul’s life will produce: “I know that I will remain\nand continue with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith.”\nSo we can see Paul gradually clarifying what he means by “For\nme to live is Christ.”\nFirst, it means: my life is dedicated to producing fruit (v. 22).\nSecond, it means: my life is devoted to producing a fruit that is\nvery necessary for you to have (v. 24). Third, it means: my life\nis devoted to increasing your faith and helping it to overflow\nwith joy (v. 25).\nNow the crucial question is: Why in Paul’s mind is it one and\nthe same thing to say on the one hand, “For me to live is Christ,”\nand to say on the other hand, “My life is devoted to your progress\nand joy in the faith”? I think those two statements are virtually\nsynonymous for Paul in this context.\n\nI Live for Your Progress and Joy in Faith\nTo see this we need a definition of faith. Ordinarily faith would\nmean trust or confidence you put in someone who has given good\nevidence of his reliability and willingness and ability to provide\n\n[PAGE 66]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\nwhat you need. But when Jesus Christ is the object of faith there\nis a twist. He himself is what we need. If we only trust Christ to\ngive us gifts and not himself as the all-satisfying gift, then we do\nnot trust him in a way that honors him as our treasure. We simply\nhonor the gifts. They are what we really want, not him. So biblical\nfaith in Jesus must mean that we trust him to give us what we need\nmost—namely, himself. That means that faith itself must include\nat its essence a treasuring of Christ above all things.\nNow we are in a position to see why Paul’s two aims for his\nlife are in fact one. According to verse 20, his aim is to magnify\nChrist in life; and according to verse 25, his aim is to promote the\nprogress and joy in the Philippians’ faith. That is why he believes\nGod might let him live. This would be his life: to labor for their\n“progress and joy in the faith.”\nBut now we have seen that faith is essentially treasuring\nChrist. The word “joy” in verse 25 (“for your . . . joy in the\nfaith”) signals that this treasuring is a joyful treasuring. And if\nChrist is joyfully treasured, he is magnified. That is the single, allembracing passion of Paul’s life. In other words, Paul is saying,\n“My life is devoted to producing in you that one great experience\nof the heart by which Christ is magnified—namely, being satisfied\nin him, joyfully treasuring him above all else. That’s what I mean\nwhen I say, ‘For me to live is Christ.’ That is, for me to live is your\nChrist-magnifying faith.”\n\nThe Christian Life Is Many Deaths\nIt would be a great mistake at this point if we separated the way\ndeath honors Christ from the way life honors Christ. The reason\nthis would be a mistake is that the life of a Christian includes many\ndeaths. Paul said, “I die every day!” (1 Cor. 15:31). Jesus said, “If\nanyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up\nhis cross daily and follow me” (Luke 9:23). Daily Christian living\nis daily Christian dying. The dying I have in mind is the dying of\ncomfort and security and reputation and health and family and\n\n\fMagnifying Christ through Pain and Death 67\n\nfriends and wealth and homeland. These may be taken from us\nat any time in the path of Christ-exalting obedience. To die daily\nthe way Paul did, and to take up our cross daily the way Jesus\ncommanded, is to embrace this life of loss for Christ’s sake and\ncount it gain.\nIn other words, the way we honor Christ in death is to treasure Jesus above the gift of life, and the way we honor Christ in\nlife is to treasure Jesus above life’s gifts. This is why Paul used the\nsame word “gain” in relation to Christ at death and in relation\nto Christ in life. Not only did he say, “To die is gain,” but he also\nsaid, “Whatever gain I had [in life!], I counted as loss for the sake\nof Christ. Indeed, I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have\nsuffered the loss of all things and count them as rubbish, in order\nthat I may gain Christ” (Phil. 3:7–8).\n\nPain and Pleasure as Ways to Make Much of Christ\nAll of life for the Christian is meant to magnify Christ. This can\nhappen through pleasure, and it can happen through pain. We\nare focusing here on the pain. The reason for this is not that\na thousand pleasant things don’t come our way as Christians.\nNor is it that we should not enjoy them as gifts of God and glorify him with thanksgiving. We should. That is what the Bible\nteaches. “Everything created by God is good, and nothing is\nto be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving, for it is made\nholy by the word of God and prayer” (1 Tim. 4:4–5). And it is\ntrue that “The one who offers thanksgiving as his sacrifice glorifies me” (Ps. 50:23).\nThe reason I don’t stress this is that we are spring-loaded to\nsee the pleasant side of truth. We are fallen, comfort-loving creatures. We are always on the lookout for ways to justify our selfprotecting, self-securing, self-pleasing ways of life. I know this\nabout myself. And I am glad that this is not all bad. God “richly\nsupplies us with everything to enjoy” (1 Tim. 6:17).\n\n[PAGE 68]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\nHow We Handle Loss Shows Who Our Treasure Is\nBut what I know even more surely is that the greatest joy in God\ncomes from giving his gifts away, not in hoarding them for ourselves. It is good to work and have. It is better to work and have\nin order to give. God’s glory shines more brightly when he satisfies\nus in times of loss than when he provides for us in times of plenty.\nThe health, wealth, and prosperity “gospel” swallows up the\nbeauty of Christ in the beauty of his gifts and turns the gifts into\nidols. The world is not impressed when Christians get rich and\nsay thanks to God. They are impressed when God is so satisfying\nthat we give our riches away for Christ’s sake and count it gain.\nNo one ever said that they learned their deepest lessons of life,\nor had their sweetest encounters with God, on the sunny days.\nPeople go deep with God when the drought comes. That is the\nway God designed it. Christ aims to be magnified in life most\nclearly by the way we experience him in our losses. Paul is our\nexample: “We were so utterly burdened beyond our strength that\nwe despaired of life itself. Indeed, we felt that we had received the\nsentence of death. But that was to make us rely not on ourselves\nbut on God who raises the dead” (2 Cor. 1:8–9). The design of\nPaul’s suffering was to make radically clear for his own soul, and\nfor ours, that God and God alone is the only treasure who lasts.\nWhen everything in life is stripped away except God, and we trust\nhim more because of it, this is gain, and he is glorified.\n\nWasting Life by Running from Pain\nThis design for the Christian life is so crucial that we should open\nour eyes to see how extensively the Bible speaks about it. Untold\nnumbers of professing Christians waste their lives trying to escape\nthe cost of love. They do not see that it is always worth it. There\nis more of God’s glory to be seen and savored through suffering\nthan through self-serving escape. Paul puts it like this: “Though\nour outer nature is wasting away, our inner nature is being renewed every day. For this slight momentary affliction is preparing\n\n\fMagnifying Christ through Pain and Death 69\n\nfor us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison” (2 Cor.\n4:16–17). “Momentary” refers to a lifetime in comparison with\neternity. “Slight” refers to suffering and death compared to the\nweight of everlasting joy in the presence of God. This is what we\ngain if we hold fast to Christ. This is what we waste if we don’t.\nGod designs that tribulations intensify our hope for the glory\nof God. Paul says in Romans 5:2 that we have access by faith into\ngrace and “rejoice in hope of the glory of God.” Then he tells us\nin the next two verses how that hope is preserved and sweetened:\n“Not only that, we rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance, and endurance produces character, and\ncharacter produces hope” (vv. 3–4). This hope that grows and\ndeepens and satisfies through suffering is the hope of verse 2, the\n“hope of the glory of God.” We were made to see and savor this\nglory. And God, in love, will use whatever trials are necessary to\nintensify our savoring of his glory.\n\nThere Is a Difference between Sacrifice and Suicide\nIt is not wrong to pray for healing, to take medicine, to put locks\non your doors, to flee unruly mobs. The Bible does not call for\nsuicide. It is presumption to jump off the temple while quoting\nScripture promises that God will catch you. God finally decides\nwhether and when the path of obedience will lead to suffering.\nSatan has his place. He loves to make us miserable and tries to\ndestroy our faith. But God is sovereign over Satan, and all of Satan’s aims to destroy the saints are designed by God for the good\nof his people and the glory of his name.\nSo it is right to flee, and it is right to stay. One may escape,\nand one may endure hardship. When to flee and when to stay is\nan agonizing question for many missionaries and urban workers\nand Christians in secular workplaces with great opportunity and\ngreat conflict. One person who thought more about it than most\nof us was John Bunyan, the pastor who spent twelve years in\nprison and wrote Pilgrim’s Progress. He could have been released\n\n[PAGE 70]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\nfrom prison if he had agreed not to preach. His wife and children\nneeded him. One of his daughters was blind. It was an agonizing decision. “The parting with my wife and poor children hath\noften been to me in this place as the pulling of the Flesh from\nmy bones.”5\nHere is what he wrote about the Christian’s freedom to stay\nor flee from danger.\nMay we try to escape? Thou mayest do in this as it is in thy\nheart. If it is in thy heart to fly, fly: if it be in thy heart to stand,\nstand. Any thing but a denial of the truth. He that flies, has\nwarrant to do so; he that stands, has warrant to do so. Yea,\nthe same man may both fly and stand, as the call and working of God with his heart may be. Moses fled, Exodus 2:15;\nMoses stood, Hebrews 11:27. David fled, 1 Samuel 19:12;\nDavid stood, 1 Samuel 24:8. Jeremiah fled, Jeremiah 37:11–\n12; Jeremiah stood, Jeremiah 38:17. Christ withdrew himself,\nLuke 9:10; Christ stood, John 18:1–8. Paul fled, 2 Corinthians\n11:33; Paul stood, Acts 20:22–23. . . .\nThere are few rules in this case. The man himself is best\nable to judge concerning his present strength, and what\nweight this or that argument has upon his heart to stand or\nfly. . . . Do not fly out of a slavish fear, but rather because\nflying is an ordinance of God, opening a door for the escape\nof some, which door is opened by God’s providence, and the\nescape countenanced by God’s Word.

And when persecution pauses, the groanings of this age\nremain. “We ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit,\ngroan inwardly as we wait eagerly for adoption as sons, the\nredemption of our bodies” (Rom. 8:23). We will groan one way\nor the other. As Paul said, “sorrowful, yet always rejoicing”\n(2 Cor. 6:10).\nThat is the promise. Here’s the design. Jesus said to Paul in\npain—and to all of us who treasure him more than pain-free\nliving—“My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made\nperfect in weakness” (2 Cor. 12:9). Many professing Christians\nwould get angry at this design. They might even scream, “I don’t\ncare about your power being perfected! I am in pain! If you love\nme, get me out of this!” That was not Paul’s response. Paul had\nlearned what love is. Love is not Christ’s making much of us or\nmaking life easy. Love is doing what he must do, at great cost\nto himself (and often to us), to enable us to enjoy making much\nof him forever. So Paul responds to Christ’s design, “Therefore\nI will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the\npower of Christ may rest upon me. For the sake of Christ, then,\nI am content with weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions,\nand calamities. For when I am weak, then I am strong” (2 Cor.\n12:9–10).\n\nAll Lasting Joy Is on the Calvary Road\nWhat a tragic waste when people turn away from the Calvary\nroad of love and suffering. All the riches of the glory of God in\nChrist are on that road. All the sweetest fellowship with Jesus is\nthere. All the treasures of assurance. All the ecstasies of joy. All the\nclearest sightings of eternity. All the noblest camaraderie. All the\nhumblest affections. All the most tender acts of forgiving kindness.\n\n[PAGE 72]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\nAll the deepest discoveries of God’s Word. All the most earnest\nprayers. They are all on the Calvary road where Jesus walks with\nhis people. Take up your cross and follow Jesus. On this road,\nand this road alone, life is Christ and death is gain. Life on every\nother road is wasted.\n\n\f5\n\nRisk Is Right—Better to Lose\nYour Life Than to Waste It\n\nIf our single, all-embracing passion is to make much of Christ in\nlife and death, and if the life that magnifies him most is the life of\ncostly love, then life is risk, and risk is right. To run from it is to\nwaste your life.\n\nWhat Is Risk?\nI define risk very simply as an action that exposes you to the possibility of loss or injury. If you take a risk you can lose money,\nyou can lose face, you can lose your health or even your life. And\nwhat’s worse, if you take a risk, you may endanger other people\nand not just yourself. Their lives may be at stake. Will a wise and\nloving person, then, ever take a risk? Is it wise to expose yourself\nto loss? Is it loving to endanger others? Is losing life the same as\nwasting it?\nIt depends. Of course you can throw your life away in a hundred sinful ways and die as a result. In that case, losing life and\nwasting it would be the same. But losing life is not always the same\nas wasting it. What if the circumstances are such that not taking a\n\n[PAGE 74]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\nrisk will result in loss and injury? It may not be wise to play it safe.\nAnd what if a successful risk would bring great benefit to many\npeople, and its failure would bring harm only to yourself? It may\nnot be loving to choose comfort or security when something great\nmay be achieved for the cause of Christ and for the good of others.\n\nRisk Is Woven into the Fabric of Our Finite Lives\nWhy is there such a thing as risk? Because there is such a thing\nas ignorance. If there were no ignorance there would be no risk.\nRisk is possible because we don’t know how things will turn out.\nThis means that God can take no risks.1 He knows the outcome\nof all his choices before they happen. This is what it means to be\nGod over against all the gods of the nations (Isa. 41:23; 42:8–9;\n44:6–8; 45:21; 46:8–11; 48:3). And since he knows the outcome\nof all his actions before they happen, he plans accordingly. His\nomniscience rules out the very possibility of taking risks.2\nBut not so with us. We are not God; we are ignorant. We don’t\nknow what will happen tomorrow. God does not tell us in detail\nwhat he intends to do tomorrow or five years from now. Evidently\nGod intends for us to live and act in ignorance and in uncertainty\nabout the outcome of our actions.\nHe says to us, for example, in James 4:13–15:\nCome now, you who say, “Today or tomorrow we will go into\nsuch and such a town and spend a year there and trade and\n1. This view is clearly and consciously opposed to the view called open theism which\nbelieves that God takes real risks in the sense that he does not know the outcome of many\nevents that he sets in motion. This view is represented, for example, by John Sanders, The\nGod Who Risks: A Theology of Providence (Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity Press, 1998)\nand Gregory A. Boyd, Satan and the Problem of Evil: Constructing a Trinitarian Warfare\nTheodicy (Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity Press, 2001) and is criticized effectively, I believe,\nby R. K. McGregor Wright, No Place for Sovereignty: What’s Wrong with Freewill Theism?\n(Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity Press, 1996); Bruce A. Ware, God’s Lesser Glory: The Diminished God of Open Theism (Wheaton, IL: Crossway, 2000); John M. Frame, No Other\nGod: A Response to Open Theism (Phillipsburg, NJ: P&R, 2001); and John Piper, Justin\nTaylor, Paul Kjoss Helseth, eds., Beyond the Bounds: Open Theism and the Undermining of\nBiblical Christianity (Wheaton, IL: Crossway, 2003).\n2. See more on why God cannot be a risk-taker in John Piper, The Pleasures of God: Meditations on God’s Delight in Being God, 2nd ed. (Sisters, OR: Multnomah, 2000), 54–62.\n\n\fRisk Is Right—Better to Lose Your Life Than to Waste It\n\n[PAGE 75]\n\nmake a profit”—yet you do not know what tomorrow will\nbring. What is your life? For you are a mist that appears for a\nlittle time and then vanishes. Instead you ought to say, “If the\nLord wills, we will live and do this or that.”\n\nYou don’t know if your heart will stop before you finish reading this page. You don’t know if some oncoming driver will swerve\nout of his lane and hit you head-on in the next week, or if the food\nin the restaurant may have some deadly virus in it, or if a stroke\nmay paralyze you before the week is out, or if some man with a\nrifle will shoot you at the shopping center. We are not God. We do\nnot know about tomorrow.\n\nExploding the Myth of Safety\nTherefore risk is woven into the fabric of our finite lives. We cannot avoid risk even if we want to. Ignorance and uncertainty about\ntomorrow is our native air. All of our plans for tomorrow’s activities\ncan be shattered by a thousand unknowns whether we stay at home\nunder the covers or ride the freeways. One of my aims is to explode\nthe myth of safety and to somehow deliver you from the enchantment of security. Because it’s a mirage. It doesn’t exist. Every direction you turn there are unknowns and things beyond your control.\nThe tragic hypocrisy is that the enchantment of security lets\nus take risks every day for ourselves but paralyzes us from taking\nrisks for others on the Calvary road of love. We are deluded and\nthink that it may jeopardize a security that in fact does not even\nexist. The way I hope to explode the myth of safety and to disenchant you with the mirage of security is simply to go to the Bible\nand show that it is right to risk for the cause of Christ, and that\nnot to is to waste your life.\n\n“May the Lord Do What Seems Good to Him”\nConsider the context of 2 Samuel 10. The Amalekites had shamed\nthe messengers of Israel and made themselves odious in the sight\n\n[PAGE 76]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\nof David. To protect themselves they had hired the Syrians to\nfight with them against the Israelites. Joab, the commander of\nIsrael’s forces, found himself surrounded with Amalekites on one\nside and Syrians on the other. So he divided his troops, put his\nbrother Abishai in charge of one troop of fighters, and led the\nother himself.\nIn verse 11 they pledged to help each other. Then comes this\ngreat word in verse 12: “Be of good courage, and let us be courageous for our people, and for the cities of our God, and may the\nLord do what seems good to him.” What do these last words\nmean, “May the Lord do what seems good to him”? It means that\nJoab had made a strategic decision for the cities of God, and he\ndid not know how it would turn out. He had no special revelation\nfrom God on this issue. He had to make a decision on the basis of\nsanctified wisdom. He had to risk or run. He did not know how it\nwould turn out. So he made his decision, and he handed the results\nover to God. And this was right.\n\n“If I Perish, I Perish”\nQueen Esther is another example of courageous risk in the service of\nlove and for the glory of God. There was a Jewish man named Mordecai who lived in the fifth century before Christ during the Jews’\nexile. He had a younger orphaned cousin named Esther whom he\nhad adopted as a daughter. She grew up to be beautiful and eventually was taken by Persia’s King Ahasuerus to be his queen. Haman,\none of Ahasuerus’s chief princes, hated Mordecai and all the Jewish\nrefugees and persuaded the king to decree that they be exterminated. The king did not realize that his own queen was a Jew.\nMordecai sent word to Esther to go before the king and plead\nthe case of her people. But Esther knew there was a royal law that\nanyone who approached the king without being called would be\nput to death, unless he lifted his golden scepter. She also knew\nthat her people’s lives were at stake. Esther sent her response to\nMordecai with these words:\n\n\fRisk Is Right—Better to Lose Your Life Than to Waste It\n\n[PAGE 77]\n\nGo, gather all the Jews to be found in Susa, and hold a fast\non my behalf, and do not eat or drink for three days, night or\nday. I and my young women will also fast as you do. Then I\nwill go to the king, though it is against the law, and if I perish,\nI perish. (Est. 4:15–16)\n\n“If I perish, I perish.” What does that mean? It means that\nEsther did not know what the outcome of her act would be. She\nhad no special revelation from God. She made her decision on the\nbasis of wisdom and love for her people and trust in God. She had\nto risk or run. She did not know how it would turn out. So she\nmade her decision and handed the results over to God. “If I perish,\nI perish.” And this was right.\n\n“We Will Not Serve Your Gods”\nConsider one more example from the Old Testament. The setting\nis Babylon. The Jewish people are in exile. The king is Nebuchadnezzar. He sets up an image of gold, then commands that when\nthe trumpet sounds, all the people will bow down to the image.\nBut Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego did not bow down. They\nworshiped the one true God of Israel.\nSo Nebuchadnezzar threatened them and said that if they did\nnot worship the image, they would be thrown into the fiery furnace. They answered:\nO Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer you in this\nmatter. If this be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver\nus from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out\nof your hand, O king. But if not, be it known to you, O king,\nthat we will not serve your gods or worship the golden image\nthat you have set up. (Dan. 3:16–18)\n\nThis was sheer risk. “We believe our God will deliver us. But even\nif he doesn’t, we will not serve your gods.” They did not know\nhow it would turn out. They said virtually the same thing Esther\nsaid: “If we perish, we perish.” And they handed the outcome to\n\n[PAGE 78]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\nGod the same way Joab and Abishai did: “And may the Lord do\nwhat seems good to him.” And this was right. It is right to risk\nfor the cause of God.\n\n“I Am Ready to Die for the Name of the Lord Jesus”\nThe great New Testament risk-taker was the apostle Paul. Picture\nhim first on his way to Jerusalem after years of suffering for Christ\nalmost everywhere he went. He had bound himself in the Holy\nSpirit (Acts 19:21) to go to Jerusalem. He had collected money for\nthe poor, and he was going to see that it was delivered faithfully.\nHe got as far as Caesarea, and a prophet named Agabus came\ndown from Judea, symbolically bound his own hands and feet\nwith Paul’s belt, and said, “Thus says the Holy Spirit, ‘This is how\nthe Jews at Jerusalem will bind the man who owns this belt and\ndeliver him into the hands of the Gentiles’” (Acts 21:11).\nWhen the believers heard this, they begged Paul not to go to\nJerusalem. He responded, “What are you doing, weeping and\nbreaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be imprisoned but\neven to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus” (Acts\n21:13). Then, Luke tells us, his friends relented: “And since he\nwould not be persuaded, we ceased and said, ‘Let the will of the\nLord be done’” (Acts 21:14).\nIn other words, Paul believed that this trip to Jerusalem was\nnecessary for the cause of Christ. He did not know the details of\nwhat would happen there or what the outcome would be. Arrest\nand affliction for sure. But then what? Death? Imprisonment? Banishment? No one knew. So what did they say? They could agree\non one thing: “The will of the Lord be done!” Or as Joab said,\n“May the Lord do what seems good to him.” And this was right.\n\n“In Every City . . . Afflictions Await Me”\nIn fact, Paul’s whole life was one stressful risk after another. He\nsaid in Acts 20:23, “The Holy Spirit testifies to me in every city that\nimprisonment and afflictions await me.” But he never knew in what\n\n\fRisk Is Right—Better to Lose Your Life Than to Waste It\n\n[PAGE 79]\n\nform they would come, or when they would come, or by whom\nthey would come. Paul had decided to risk his life in Jerusalem with\nthe full knowledge of what it might be like. What he had already\nendured left him no doubt about what might happen in Jerusalem:\nFive times I received at the hands of the Jews the forty lashes\nless one. Three times I was beaten with rods. Once I was\nstoned. Three times I was shipwrecked; a night and a day I\nwas adrift at sea; on frequent journeys, in danger from rivers,\ndanger from robbers, danger from my own people, danger\nfrom Gentiles, danger in the city, danger in the wilderness,\ndanger at sea, danger from false brothers; in toil and hardship,\nthrough many a sleepless night, in hunger and thirst, often\nwithout food, in cold and exposure. And, apart from other\nthings, there is the daily pressure on me of my anxiety for all\nthe churches. (2 Cor. 11:24–28)\n\nWhat does this mean? It means that Paul never knew where\nthe next blow would come from. Every day he risked his life for\nthe cause of God. The roads weren’t safe. The rivers weren’t safe.\nHis own people, the Jews, weren’t safe. The Gentiles weren’t safe.\nThe cities weren’t safe. The wilderness wasn’t safe. The sea wasn’t\nsafe. Even the so-called Christian brothers weren’t safe. Safety was\na mirage. It didn’t exist for the apostle Paul.\nHe had two choices: waste his life or live with risk. And he\nanswered this choice clearly: “But I do not account my life of any\nvalue nor as precious to myself, if only I may finish my course and\nthe ministry that I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to the\ngospel of the grace of God” (Acts 20:24). He never knew what the\nday would hold. But the Calvary road beckoned. And he risked\nhis life every day. And this was right.\n\n“If They Persecuted Me, They Will Also Persecute You”\nLest we think that this risk-taking life was unique to Paul, he made\nit a point to tell young Christians that they would meet unspecified\n\n[PAGE 80]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\ntroubles. After establishing new churches on his first missionary\njourney, he returned some months later “strengthening the souls\nof the disciples, encouraging them to continue in the faith, and\nsaying that through many tribulations we must enter the kingdom\nof God” (Acts 14:22). When he wrote to the young Thessalonian\nchurch, he expressed concern that they might have been shaken by\ntheir afflictions and said to them, “You yourselves know that we\nhave been destined for this [that is, for these afflictions]” (1 Thess.\n3:3). In other words, the Christian life is a call to risk.\nJesus had made this clear. He said, for example, in Luke 21:16,\n“You will be delivered up even by parents and brothers and relatives and friends, and some of you they will put to death.” The\nkey word here is some. “Some of you they will put to death.” This\nword puts the earthly life of the disciples in great uncertainty. Not\nall will die for the cause of Christ. But not all will live either. Some\nwill die. And some will live. This is what I mean by risk. It is the\nwill of God that we be uncertain about how life on this earth will\nturn out for us. And therefore it is the will of the Lord that we take\nrisks for the cause of God.\nLife was hard for Jesus, and he said it would be hard for his\nfollowers. “Remember the word that I said to you: ‘A servant is\nnot greater than his master.’ If they persecuted me, they will also\npersecute you” (John 15:20). So Peter warned the churches of Asia\nthat mistreatment would be normal. “Beloved, do not be surprised\nat the fiery trial when it comes upon you to test you, as though\nsomething strange were happening to you. But rejoice insofar as\nyou share Christ’s sufferings, that you may also rejoice and be\nglad when his glory is revealed. If you are insulted for the name\nof Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God\nrests upon you” (1 Pet. 4:12–14).\n\nTo Become a Christian Was to Risk Your Life\nThe first three centuries of the Christian church set the pattern of\ngrowth under threat. Stephen Neill, in his History of Christian\n\n\fRisk Is Right—Better to Lose Your Life Than to Waste It\n\n[PAGE 81]\n\nMissions, wrote, “Undoubtedly, Christians under the Roman Empire had no legal right to existence, and were liable to the utmost\nstringency of the law. . . . Every Christian knew that sooner or\nlater he might have to testify to his faith at the cost of his life.”3\nMight. There’s the risk. It was always there. Maybe we will be\nkilled for being Christians. Maybe we won’t. It is a risk. That was\nnormal. And to become a Christian under those circumstances\nwas right.\nIn fact, it was the Christ-exalting love that the Christians\nshowed in spite of risk that stunned the pagan world. The Roman\nEmperor Julian (AD 332–363) wanted to breathe new life into\nthe ancient pagan religion but saw more and more people drawn\nto Christianity. He wrote with frustration against these “atheists”\n(who did not believe in the Roman gods, but in Christ):\nAtheism [i.e., Christian faith] has been specially advanced\nthrough the loving service rendered to strangers, and through\ntheir care for the burial of the dead. It is a scandal there is not\na single Jew who is a beggar, and that the godless Galileans\ncare not only for their own poor but for ours as well; while\nthose who belong to us look in vain for the help that we should\nrender them.4\n\nIt is costly to follow Christ. There is risk everywhere. But, as\nwe saw in chapter 3, this very risk is the means by which the value\nof Christ shines more brightly.\n\nHow to Waste Forty Years and Thousands of Lives\nBut what happens when the people of God do not escape from the\nbeguiling enchantment of security? What happens if they try to\nlive their lives in the mirage of safety? The answer is wasted lives.\nDo you remember the time it happened?\nIt had been less than three years since the people of Israel came\n3. Stephen Neill, A History of Christian Missions (Middlesex: Penguin, 1964), 42–43.\n4. Ibid., 42.\n\n[PAGE 82]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\nout of Egypt by the power of God. Now they were on the borders\nof the Promised Land. The Lord said to Moses, “Send men to spy\nout the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the people of Israel”\n(Num. 13:2). So Moses sent Caleb, Joshua, and ten other men.\nAfter forty days they returned with a huge cluster of grapes hung\non a pole between two men. Caleb issued the hope-filled call to\nhis people: “Let us go up at once and occupy it, for we are well\nable to overcome it” (Num. 13:30). But the others said, “We are\nnot able to go up against the people, for they are stronger than\nwe are” (v. 31).\nCaleb was unable to explode the myth of safety. The people\nwere gripped by the beguiling enchantment of security—the notion\nthat there is a sheltered way of life apart from the path of Godexalting obedience. They murmured against Moses and Aaron and\ndecided to go back to Egypt—the great mirage of safety.\nJoshua tried to free them from their stupor.\nThe land, which we passed through to spy it out, is an exceedingly good land. If the Lord delights in us, he will bring us\ninto this land and give it to us, a land that flows with milk and\nhoney. Only do not rebel against the Lord. And do not fear\nthe people of the land, for they are bread for us. Their protection is removed from them, and the Lord is with us; do not\nfear them. (Num.14:7–9)\n\nBut not even Joshua could explode the myth of safety. The\npeople were drunk in a dreamworld of security. And they tried to\nstone Caleb and Joshua. The result was thousands of wasted lives\nand wasted years. It was clearly wrong not to take the risk of battling the giants in the land of Canaan. Oh, how much is wasted\nwhen we do not risk for the cause of God!\n\nWhat about You?\nRisk is right. And the reason is not because God promises success\nto all our ventures in his cause. There is no promise that every ef-\n\n\fRisk Is Right—Better to Lose Your Life Than to Waste It\n\n[PAGE 83]\n\nfort for the cause of God will succeed, at least not in the short run.\nJohn the Baptist risked calling King Herod an adulterer when he\ndivorced his own wife in order to take his brother’s wife. For this\nJohn got his head chopped off. And he had done right to risk his\nlife for the cause of God and truth. Jesus had no criticism for him,\nonly the highest praise (Matt. 11:11).\nPaul risked going up to Jerusalem to complete his ministry to\nthe poor. He was beaten and thrown in prison for two years and\nthen shipped off to Rome and executed there two years later. And\nhe did right to risk his life for the cause of Christ. How many\ngraves are there in Africa and Asia because thousands of young\nmissionaries were freed by the power of the Holy Spirit from the\nenchantment of security and then risked their lives to make much\nof Christ among the unreached peoples of the world!\nAnd now what about you? Are you caught in the enchantment\nof security, paralyzed from taking any risks for the cause of God?\nOr have you been freed by the power of the Holy Spirit from the\nmirage of Egyptian safety and comfort? Do you men ever say with\nJoab, “For the sake of the name, I’ll try it! And may the Lord do\nwhat seems good to him”? Do you women ever say with Esther,\n“For the sake of Christ, I’ll try it! And if I perish, I perish”?\n\nRisking for the Wrong Reasons\nThere is more than one danger in calling Christians to take risks.\nI mentioned one of them in chapter 4, namely, that we might\nbecome so fixated on self-denial that we are unable to enjoy the\nproper pleasures of this life that God has given for our good.\nAnother danger, which is worse, is that we might be drawn to a\nlife of risk for self-exalting reasons. We might feel the adrenaline\nof heroism rising. We might scorn the lazy and cowardly and feel\nsuperior. We might think of risk as a kind of righteousness that\nmakes us acceptable to God. What would be missing from all these\nmistakes is childlike faith in the sovereign rule of God in the world\nand in his triumphant love.\n\n[PAGE 84]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\nI have been assuming that the power and the motive behind\ntaking risks for the cause of God is not heroism, or the lust for\nadventure, or the courage of self-reliance, or the need to earn\nGod’s good will, but rather faith in the all-providing, all-ruling,\nall-satisfying Son of God, Jesus Christ. The strength to risk losing\nface for the sake of Christ is the faith that God’s love will lift up\nyour face in the end and vindicate your cause. The strength to risk\nlosing money for the cause of the gospel is the faith that we have a\ntreasure in the heavens that cannot fail. The strength to risk losing\nlife in this world is faith in the promise that he who loses his life\nin this world will save it for the age to come.\nThis is very different from heroism and self-reliance. When\nwe risk losing face or money or life because we believe God will\nalways help us and use our loss, in the end, to make us more glad\nin his glory, then it’s not we who get the praise because of our\ncourage; it’s God who gets the praise because of his care. In this\nway risk reflects God’s value, not our valor.\nThis foundation for fearlessness must not be assumed. We are\nwired to risk for the wrong reasons. Without Christ, we are all\nlegalists or lechers at heart—wanting to do our own thing, or\nwanting to do God’s thing in our way to prove our own ability.\nSince we are wired this way, we need protection. God has given us\nanother way to pursue risk. Do it “by the strength that God supplies—in order that in everything God may be glorified through\nJesus Christ” (1 Pet. 4:11). And the way God supplies his strength\nis through faith in his promises. Every loss we risk in order to\nmake much of Christ, God promises to restore a thousandfold\nwith his all-satisfying fellowship.\n\nThe Power to Risk Is in the Promise of God\nEarlier in this chapter I mentioned Luke 21:16 where Jesus says to\nhis disciples, “Some of you they will put to death.” But I did not\nmention the promise that follows: “You will be hated by all for my\nname’s sake. But not a hair of your head will perish” (vv. 17–18).\n\n\fRisk Is Right—Better to Lose Your Life Than to Waste It\n\n[PAGE 85]\n\nThis is one of those painful paradoxes in the Bible: “Some of you\nthey will put to death. . . . But not a hair of your head will perish”!\nWhat does this mean? What is Jesus trying to say to us when he\nsays, “Go ahead and risk obedience; some of you they will put to\ndeath; but not a hair of your head will perish”?\nI think the best commentary on these verses is Romans 8:35–39.\nWho shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or\ndanger, or sword? As it is written, “For your sake we are being\nkilled all the day long; we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered.” No, in all these things we are more than conquerors\nthrough him who loved us. For I am sure that neither death\nnor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to\ncome, nor powers, nor height nor depth, nor anything else in\nall creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God\nin Christ Jesus our Lord.\n\nCompare these terrible and wonderful words with what Jesus\nsaid: “Some of you they will put to death. . . . But not a hair of\nyour head will perish.”\nLike Jesus, Paul says that the love of Christ for us does not eliminate our suffering. On the contrary, our very attachment to Christ\nwill bring suffering. What is Paul’s answer to his own question in\nverse 35: “Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine,\nor nakedness, or danger, or sword . . . separate us from the love\nof Christ?” His answer in verse 37 is a resounding NO! But don’t\nmiss the implication of the question: The reason these things will\nnot separate us from the love of Christ is not because they don’t\nhappen to people whom Christ loves. They do. Paul’s quoting of\nPsalm 44:22 shows that these things do in fact happen to Christ’s\npeople. “For your sake we are being killed all the day long; we are\nregarded as sheep to be slaughtered.” In other words, Christ’s love\nfor us does not spare us these sufferings. Risk is real. The Christian\nlife is a painful life. Not joyless. But not painless either.\n\n[PAGE 86]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\nDoes God Really Supply All We Need?\nThis is the meaning of the little word “in” found in verse 37: “In\nall these things we are more than conquerors. . . . ” We are more\nthan conquerors in our afflictions, not by avoiding them. So Paul\nagrees with Jesus: “Some of you they will put to death.” Obedience is risk. And it is right to risk for the cause of God. Some of\nthe risks are mentioned in verse 35:\n• “tribulation”—the trouble and oppression of various kinds\nthat Paul says we must walk through on our way to heaven\n(Acts 14:22).\n• “distress”—calamities that bring stress and threaten to\nbreak us like a stick (2 Cor. 6:4; 12:10).\n• “persecution”—active opposition from the enemies of the\ngospel (Matt. 5:11–12).\n• “danger”—every kind of threat or menace to body, soul,\nand family (2 Cor. 11:26).\n• “sword”—the weapon that killed James (Acts 12:2).\n• “famine and nakedness”—the lack of food and clothing.\n\nI put “famine and nakedness” last because they pose the greatest problem. Did not Jesus say:\nDo not be anxious about your life, what you will eat or what\nyou will drink, nor about your body, what you will put on.\nIs not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?\n. . . do not be anxious, saying, “What shall we eat?” or “What\nshall we drink?” or “What shall we wear?” . . . your heavenly\nFather knows that you need them all. But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be\nadded to you. (Matt. 6:25, 31–33)\n\n“Well, which is it?” we might ask. Are Christians subject to\n“famine and nakedness” (Rom. 8:35) or will God provide “all\nthese things” (Matt. 6:33) when we need them? Will Christians\nnever hunger or starve or be ill-clothed? Have not some of the\ngreatest saints in the world been stripped and starved? What about\n\n\fRisk Is Right—Better to Lose Your Life Than to Waste It\n\n[PAGE 87]\n\nHebrews 11:37–38? “They were stoned, they were sawn in two,\nthey were killed with the sword. They went about in skins of sheep\nand goats, destitute, afflicted, mistreated—of whom the world was\nnot worthy—wandering about in deserts and mountains, and in\ndens and caves of the earth.” The losses and miseries of these believers was not owing to their unbelief. They were faithful—people\n“of whom the world was not worthy.”\n\nAll You Need to Do His Will and Be Happy Forever\nWhat, then, does Jesus mean, “All these things—all your food\nand clothing—will be added to you when you seek the kingdom\nof God first”? He means the same thing he meant when he said,\n“Some of you they will put to death. . . . But not a hair of your\nhead will perish” (Luke 21:16–18). He meant that you will have\neverything you need to do his will and be eternally and supremely\nhappy in him.\nHow much food and clothing are necessary? Necessary for\nwhat? we must ask. Necessary to be comfortable? No, Jesus did\nnot promise comfort. Necessary to avoid shame? No, Jesus called\nus to bear shame for his name with joy. Necessary to stay alive?\nNo, he did not promise to spare us death—of any kind. Persecution and plague consume the saints. Christians die on the scaffold,\nand Christians die of disease. That’s why Paul wrote, “We ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we\nwait eagerly for adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies”\n(Rom. 8:23).\nWhat Jesus meant was that our Father in heaven would never\nlet us be tested beyond what we are able (1 Cor. 10:13). If there is\none scrap of bread that you need, as God’s child, in order to keep\nyour faith in the dungeon of starvation, you will have it. God does\nnot promise enough food for comfort or life—he promises enough\nso that you can trust him and do his will.5\n5. This is the way I would understand the many general promises in the Old Testament\nto the effect that the needs of the righteous will always be met. For example, Proverbs 10:3,\n\n[PAGE 88]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\nI Can Do All Things through Christ, Even Starve\nWhen Paul promised, “My God will supply every need of yours\naccording to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus,” he had just said,\n“I know how to be brought low, and I know how to abound. In any\nand every circumstance, I have learned the secret of facing plenty\nand hunger, abundance and need. I can do all things through\nhim who strengthens me” (Phil. 4:12–13, 19). “All things” means\n“I can suffer hunger through him who strengthens me. I can be\ndestitute of food and clothing through him who strengthens me.”\nThat is what Jesus promises. He will never leave us or forsake us\n(Heb. 13:5). If we starve, he will be our everlasting, life-giving\nbread. If we are shamed with nakedness, he will be our perfect,\nall-righteous apparel. If we are tortured and made to scream in our\ndying pain, he will keep us from cursing his name and will restore\nour beaten body to everlasting beauty.\n\nThe Far Side of Every Risk, Triumphant Love\nThe bottom-line comfort and assurance in all our risk-taking for\nChrist is that nothing will ever separate us from the love of Christ.\nPaul asks, “Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine,\nor nakedness, or danger, or sword . . . separate us from the love\nof Christ?” (Rom. 8:35). His answer is, NO! In other words, no\nmisery that a true Christian ever experiences is evidence that he\nhas been cut off from the love of Christ. The love of Christ triumphs over all misery. Romans 8:38–39 makes this crystal-clear:\n“For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers,\nnor things present nor things to come, nor powers, nor height nor\ndepth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us\nfrom the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.”\nOn the far side of every risk—even if it results in death—the\n“The Lord does not let the righteous go hungry, but he thwarts the craving of the wicked.” I\nthink this is (1) generally true in the way God runs the world—upright, hardworking people\nprosper and have enough; and (2) always and absolutely true in the sense that the righteous\nwill never hunger beyond what they are able to endure for the sake of Christ. See John Piper,\n“‘No Evil Will Befall You.’ Really?” in Taste and See (Sisters, OR: Multnomah, 2005), 46–48.\n\n\fRisk Is Right—Better to Lose Your Life Than to Waste It\n\n[PAGE 89]\n\nlove of God triumphs. This is the faith that frees us to risk for the\ncause of God. It is not heroism, or lust for adventure, or courageous self-reliance, or efforts to earn God’s favor. It is childlike\nfaith in the triumph of God’s love—that on the other side of all our\nrisks, for the sake of righteousness, God will still be holding us. We\nwill be eternally satisfied in him. Nothing will have been wasted.\n\nHow Can It Get Better Than Being Conquerors?\nBut there is even more to the promise that sustains us in times\nof risk for Christ’s sake. Paul asks “If God is for us, who can be\nagainst us?” (Rom. 8:31). The answer he intends us to give is,\nnobody. It’s the same as saying, “If God is for us, no one can be\nagainst us.” That seems naïve. It’s like saying when your head is\ncut off, “Not a hair of my head has perished.” These excessive\nstatements, it seems, are meant to say more than we have said\nso far. They intend to say something more than that dying saints\nwon’t be separated from Christ.\nThis “something more” comes out in the words, “more than\nconquerors.” “In all these things we are more than conquerors\nthrough him who loved us” (Rom. 8:37). What does “more than\nconquerors” mean? How can you be more than a conqueror when\nyou risk for the cause of God and get hurt for it?\nIf you venture some act of obedience that magnifies the supreme value of Jesus Christ and get attacked by one of the enemies\nmentioned in verse 35, say, famine or sword, what must happen\nfor you to be called simply “a conqueror”? Answer: You must not\nbe separated from the love of Jesus Christ. The aim of the attacker\nis to destroy you, and cut you off from Christ, and bring you to\nfinal ruin without God. You are a conqueror if you defeat this aim\nand remain in the love of Christ. God has promised that this will\nhappen. Trusting this, we risk.\nBut what must happen in this conflict with famine and sword if\nyou are to be called more than a conqueror? One biblical answer\nis that a conqueror defeats his enemy, but one who is more than a\n\n[PAGE 90]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\nconqueror subjugates his enemy. A conqueror nullifies the purpose\nof his enemy; one who is more than a conqueror makes the enemy\nserve his own purposes. A conqueror strikes down his foe; one\nwho is more than a conqueror makes his foe his slave.\nPractically what does this mean? Let’s use Paul’s own words in\n2 Corinthians 4:17: “This slight momentary affliction is preparing [effecting, or working, or bringing about] for us an eternal\nweight of glory beyond all comparison.” Here we could say that\n“affliction” is one of the attacking enemies. What has happened\nin Paul’s conflict with it? It has certainly not separated him from\nthe love of Christ. But even more, it has been taken captive, so to\nspeak. It has been enslaved and made to serve Paul’s everlasting\njoy. “Affliction,” the former enemy, is now working for Paul. It\nis preparing for Paul “an eternal weight of glory.” His enemy is\nnow his slave. He has not only conquered his enemy. He has more\nthan conquered him.\nAffliction raised his sword to cut off the head of Paul’s faith.\nBut instead the hand of faith snatched the arm of affliction and\nforced it to cut off part of Paul’s worldliness. Affliction is made\nthe servant of godliness and humility and love. Satan meant it for\nevil, but God meant it for good. The enemy became Paul’s slave\nand worked for him an even greater weight of glory than he would\nhave ever had without the fight. In that way Paul—and every follower of Christ—is more than a conqueror.\n\nThe Only Road That Leads to Lasting Joy\nThis is the promise that empowers us to take risks for the sake of\nChrist. It is not the impulse of heroism, or the lust for adventure,\nor the courage of self-reliance, or the need to earn God’s favor.\nIt is simple trust in Christ—that in him God will do everything\nnecessary so that we can enjoy making much of him forever.\nEvery good poised to bless us, and every evil arrayed against us,\nwill in the end help us boast only in the cross, magnify Christ,\nand glorify our Creator. Faith in these promises frees us to risk",

      "content": "Risk Is Right—Better to Lose Your Life Than to Waste It\n\n[PAGE 91]\n\nand to find in our own experience that it is better to lose our life\nthan to waste it.\nTherefore, it is right to risk for the cause of Christ. It is right to\nengage the enemy and say, “May the Lord do what seems good to\nhim.” It is right to serve the people of God, and say, “If I perish,\nI perish!” It is right to stand before the fiery furnace of affliction\nand refuse to bow down to the gods of this world. This is the road\nthat leads to fullness of joy and pleasures forevermore. At the end\nof every other road—secure and risk-free—we will put our face in\nour hands and say, “I’ve wasted it!”\n\n\f\f6\n\nThe Goal of Life—Gladly\nMaking Others Glad in God\n\nIt is impossible to risk your life to make others glad in God if you\nare an unforgiving person. If you are wired to see other people’s\nfaults and failures and offenses, and treat them roughly, you will\nnot take risks for their joy. This wiring—and it is universal in all\nhuman beings—must be dismantled. We will not gladly risk to\nmake people glad in God if we hate them, or hold grudges against\nthem, or are repelled by their faults and foibles. We must become\nforgiving people.\nDon’t start raising objections about the hard cases. I am talking\nabout a spirit, not a list of criteria for when we do this or that. Nor\nam I talking about wimpy grace that can’t rebuke or discipline or\nfight. The question is, do we lean toward mercy? Do we default\nto grace? Do we have a forgiving spirit? Without it we will walk\naway from need and waste our lives.\n\nForgiveness Is Good Because It Gives Us God\nThe biblical motive for being a forgiving person may be deeper\nthan being forgiven. It is true to say: the motive for being a\n\n[PAGE 94]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\nforgiving person is that we have been forgiven by God when we\ndid not deserve it. “Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you” (Eph. 4:32). But\nthe bottom of this motive is not God’s forgiveness, but what God’s\nforgiveness gives. It gives us God.\nWhy do we cherish being forgiven by God? There are answers\nto this question that would dishonor him, because there are benefits from forgiveness that a person may love without loving God.\nWe might say, “I cherish being forgiven by God because I hate the\nmisery of a guilty conscience.” Or “ . . . because I hate the prospect\nof pain in hell.” Or “ . . . because I want to go to heaven to see my\nloved ones and have a new body with no sickness.” Where is God\nin these reasons for cherishing forgiveness? In the best case he is\nthere in all these reasons as the real treasure of life.\nIf so, then these delights are really ways of cherishing God\nhimself. A free and clean conscience enables us to see more of\nGod and frees us to enjoy him. Escape from hell at the cost of\nChrist’s blood shows us more of God’s commitment to merciful\nholiness and his desire for our happiness. The gift of seeing loved\nones highlights God’s wonder in creating relationships of love.\nGetting a new body deepens our identification with the glorified\nChrist. But if God himself is not there in these gifts—and I fear\nhe is not for many professing Christians—then we do not know\nwhat forgiveness is for.\nForgiveness is essentially God’s way of removing the great obstacle to our fellowship with him. By canceling our sin and paying\nfor it with the death of his own Son, God opens the way for us to\nsee him and know him and enjoy him forever. Seeing and savoring\nhim is the goal of forgiveness. Soul-satisfying fellowship with our\nFather is the aim of the cross. If we love being forgiven for other\nreasons alone, we are not forgiven, and we will waste our lives.\nWhat, then, is the root motivation for being a forgiving person? “Forgive one another, as God in Christ forgave you.” We are\nto forgive “as God . . . forgave” us. God forgave us in such a way\n\n\fThe Goal of Life—Gladly Making Others Glad in God 95\n\nthat infinite joy in his fellowship becomes ours. God is the goal of\nforgiveness. He is also the ground and the means of forgiveness.\nIt comes from him; it was accomplished through his Son; and it\nleads people back to him with their sins cast into the deepest sea.\nTherefore the motive for being a forgiving person is the joy of\nbeing freely and joyfully at home with God. At great cost to himself God gave us what we needed above all things: himself for our\nenjoyment forever. God’s forgiveness is important for one reason:\nIt gives us God!1\n\nWhat Forgivers Want to Give\nOur impulse for being forgiving people is the joy we have in a\nforgiving God. Not just in being forgiven, but in being given joy\nin God by being forgiven. If we do not see this and experience\nthis, we will probably turn God-centered motives into a kind\nof benevolence that tries to do good for man without knowing\nwhat the greatest good really is—namely, all-satisfying pleasure\nin God. But if we experience forgiveness as the free and undeserved gift of joy in God, then we will be carried by this joy,\nwith love, into a world of sin and suffering. Our aim there will\nbe that others, through Jesus Christ, will find forgiveness and\neverlasting joy in God.\nJoy in God overflows in glad-hearted mercy to people, because\njoy in the merciful God cannot spurn being merciful. You cannot\ndespise becoming what you enjoy about God. Joy in the God who\ndid not spare his own Son but gave him up for undeserving sinners\ncannot return evil for evil. That joy will love being merciful (Mic.\n6:8). Joy in the God who is slow to anger cannot coexist with its\nown impatience. It will fight for the triumph of what it admires in\nGod. Joy in the God who spends eternity showing “the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us” (Eph. 2:7) delights\nto be generous and looks for ways to give.\n1. For more, see John Piper, God Is the Gospel: Meditations on God’s Love as the Gift\nof Himself (Wheaton, IL: Crossway, 2005).\n\n[PAGE 96]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\nNot Christians Because They Do Not Want to Give\nRobert Murray M’Cheyne, a Scottish pastor who died at the age\nof twenty-nine in 1843, spoke of the mercy and generosity of\nChristians as the evidence that they were indeed Christians. He\nloved the poor in his parish, and he feared for those who did not\nlook for ways to show them mercy.\nI am concerned for the poor but more for you. I know not\nwhat Christ will say to you in the great day. . . . I fear there\nare many hearing me who may know well that they are not\nChristians, because they do not love to give. To give largely\nand liberally, not grudging at all, requires a new heart; an old\nheart would rather part with its life-blood than its money. Oh\nmy friends! Enjoy your money; make the most of it; give none\naway; enjoy it quickly for I can tell you, you will be beggars\nthroughout eternity.2\n\nThe Dilemma Where We No Longer Hang\nWhat is the nature and aim of glad-hearted, Christian giving? It\nis the effort—with as much creativity and sacrifice as necessary—\nto give others everlasting and ever-increasing joy3—joy in God. If\nGod is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in him, as\nwe argued in chapter 2, then living for the glory of God must mean\nthat we live to gladly make others glad in God. Our gladness and\nour pursuit of their gladness glorifies God. And since gladness in\nGod is the greatest and most lasting happiness, pursuing it is also\nlove. Since the same joy in God both satisfies man and glorifies\nGod, we never have to choose between the motive to love people\n2. Robert Murray M’Cheyne, Sermons of M’Cheyne (Edinburgh: n.p., 1848), 482, emphasis added; quoted in Timothy J. Keller, Ministries of Mercy: The Call of the Jericho Road\n(Phillipsburg, NJ: P&R, 1997), 40.\n3. I say “ever-increasing” not because we move from sadness to gladness over time in\nheaven, but because we go on from one fullness to another. I say this because a finite mind—\nand we will always be finite—cannot receive the whole of God. He is infinite. Therefore he\ncommunicates his infinite fullness to us in degrees forever. There will always be more for a\nfinite mind to see of an infinite God. As we see this, we will be more and more happy. You can\nsee more thoughts on this by Jonathan Edwards in John Piper, God’s Passion for his Glory:\nLiving the Vision of Jonathan Edwards (Wheaton, IL: Crossway, 1998), 37.\n\n\fThe Goal of Life—Gladly Making Others Glad in God 97\n\nor to glorify God.4 By gladly pursuing the gladness of others in\nGod—even at the cost of our lives—we love them and honor God.\nThis is the opposite of a wasted life.\n\nWe Cannot Make Anyone Glad in God\nHow then do we make others glad in God? That is what the next\nchapters are about. But first there are two clarifications I should\nmake. The first clarification is that, of course, we can’t make anyone glad in God. Joy in God is a fruit of the Holy Spirit (Gal.\n5:22). It is called “the joy of the Holy Spirit” (1 Thess. 1:6). It is\nthe work of God: “May the God of hope fill you with all joy and\npeace” (Rom. 15:13). It is the effect of God’s grace: “We want\nyou to know, brothers, about the grace of God that has been given\namong the churches of Macedonia, for in a severe test of affliction,\ntheir abundance of joy and their extreme poverty have overflowed\nin a wealth of generosity” (2 Cor. 8:1–2). Joy in God is awakened\nin the heart when God graciously opens our eyes to see the glory\nof Christ in the gospel (2 Cor. 4:4).\nNevertheless, even though joy in God is ultimately a gift of\nGod, he uses means to bring people into the fullness of it. Paul\ndescribed his whole ministry as laboring for the joy of others.\n“Not that we lord it over your faith, but we work with you for\nyour joy” (2 Cor. 1:24). He said to the Philippian church that the\nreason God would let him live was “for your progress and joy\nin the faith” (Phil. 1:25). Jesus said that his own words were the\nmeans God would use to give joy to his disciples: “These things I\nhave spoken to you, that my joy may be in you, and that your joy\nmay be full” (John 15:11). He also said that prayer was a means\nof joy: “Until now you have asked nothing in my name. Ask, and\nyou will receive, that your joy may be full” (John 16:24). The list\nof means could go on. But the point here is simply to show that\n4. For a more extended treatment of the unity of these two motives in the Christian life,\nsee the chapter, “A Passion for God’s Supremacy and Compassion for Man’s Soul: Jonathan\nEdwards on the Unity of Motives for World Missions,” in John Piper, Let the Nations Be\nGlad: The Supremacy of God in Missions, 2nd ed. (Grand Rapids, MI: Baker, 2003), 203–14.\n\n[PAGE 98]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\nthere are things we can do to make people glad in God, provided\nGod blesses our efforts with his decisive grace.\n\nMaking Others Glad in God Is a Massive Thing\nThe second clarification is that gladness in God is not a peripheral\nreligious experience. When I speak of making people glad in God,\nI have in mind all the saving work that God has done from beginning to end. I am not saying that gladness is the whole of salvation.\nI am saying that gladness in God is the goal of all saving work, and\nthe experiential essence of what it means to be saved. Without this\njoy in God, there would be no salvation.\nSo when I speak of making someone glad in God, I include the\nplan and grace of God “which he gave us in Christ Jesus before\nthe ages began” (2 Tim. 1:9). I include the all-sufficient redeeming work of Christ in death and resurrection (Rom. 3:24–26). I\ninclude the divine work of new birth that gives us a new nature\n(John 3:3–7; 1 Pet. 1:3, 23). I include the God-given change of\nmind called repentance that turns away from sin and turns to God\nfor help (2 Tim. 2:25; Acts 3:19; 26:20). I include faith in Jesus\nChrist that embraces him as the Savior and Lord and supreme\nTreasure of life (Phil. 3:7–9). I include the progressive change into\nChristlikeness called sanctification (Rom. 6:22; 8:29). I include the\nentire life of love that counts it more blessed to give than to receive (Acts 20:35). And I include the total renewal of body, mind,\nheart, relationships, and society that happens partially in this age,\nby the inbreaking of God’s kingdom, and then completely at the\nconsummation of God’s purposes in the age to come (Acts 3:21;\nRom. 8:23).\nWhen I speak of gladness in God, therefore, I mean a gladness\nthat has roots in God’s eternal decree, was purchased by the blood\nof Christ, springs up in the newborn heart because of God’s Spirit,\nawakens in repentance and faith, constitutes the essence of sanctification and Christlikeness, and gives rise to a life of love and a\npassion for redeeming the world after the image of God.

What paths of risk and sacrifice should\nwe take in our passion for the supremacy of God in all things, and\nin our zeal to magnify Christ, and in our single-minded commitment to boast only in the cross? That is what the next chapters\nare about.\n\n\f\f7\n\nLiving to Prove He Is More\nPrecious Than Life\n\nTo make others glad in God with an everlasting gladness, our\nlives must show that he is more precious than life. “Because your\nsteadfast love is better than life, my lips will praise you” (Ps. 63:3).\nTo do this we must make sacrificial life choices rooted in the assurance that magnifying Christ through generosity and mercy is\nmore satisfying than selfishness. If we walk away from risk to keep\nourselves safe and solvent, we will waste our lives. This chapter\nis about the kind of lifestyle that may keep that from happening.\n\nHow Not to Betray Jesus\nIf Christ is an all-satisfying treasure and promises to provide all\nour needs, even through famine and nakedness, then to live as\nthough we had all the same values as the world would betray\nhim. I have in mind mainly how we use our money and how we\nfeel about our possessions. I hear the haunting words of Jesus,\n“Do not be anxious, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall\nwe drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’ For the Gentiles seek after\nall these things” (Matt. 6:31–32). In other words, if we look\n\n[PAGE 102]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\nlike our lives are devoted to getting and maintaining things,\nwe will look like the world, and that will not make Christ\nlook great. He will look like a religious side-interest that may\nbe useful for escaping hell in the end, but doesn’t make much\ndifference in what we live and love here. He will not look like\nan all-satisfying treasure. And that will not make others glad\nin God.\nIf we are exiles and refugees on earth (1 Pet. 2:11), and if\nour citizenship is in heaven (Phil. 3:20), and if nothing can\nseparate us from the love of Christ (Rom. 8:35), and if his\nsteadfast love is better than life (Ps. 63:3), and if all hardship\nis working for us an eternal weight of glory (2 Cor. 4:17), then\nwe will give to the winds our fears and “seek first the kingdom\nof God and his righteousness” (Matt. 6:33). We will count\neverything as rubbish in comparison with Christ (Phil. 3:7–8).\nWe will “joyfully accept the plundering of our property” for the\nsake of unpopular acts of mercy (Heb. 10:34). We will choose\n“rather to be mistreated with the people of God than to enjoy\nthe fleeting pleasures of sin,” and we will count “the reproach\nof Christ greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt” (Heb.\n11:25–26).\n\nWhy Don’t People Ask Us about Our Hope?\nThere is no doubt that if we lived more like this, the world would\nbe more likely to consider whether Jesus is an all-satisfying Treasure. He would look like one. When was the last time someone\nasked you about “the reason for the hope that is in you”? That’s\nwhat Peter said we should always be ready to give an answer for:\n“Always [be] prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you\nfor a reason for the hope that is in you” (1 Pet. 3:15).\nWhy don’t people ask us about our hope? The answer is\nprobably that we look as if we hope in the same things they\ndo. Our lives don’t look like they are on the Calvary road,\nstripped down for sacrificial love, serving others with the sweet\n\n\fLiving to Prove He Is More Precious Than Life\n\n[PAGE 103]\n\nassurance that we don’t need to be rewarded in this life. Our\nreward is great in heaven (Matt. 5:12)! “You will be repaid at\nthe resurrection of the just” (Luke 14:14). If we believed this\nmore deeply, others might see the worth of God and find in him\ntheir gladness.\n\nThe Credibility of Christ Hangs on\nHow We Use Our Money\nThe issue of money and lifestyle is not a side issue in the Bible. The\ncredibility of Christ in the world hangs on it. “Fifteen percent of\neverything Christ said relates to this topic—more than his teachings on heaven and hell combined.”1 Listen to this refrain that\nruns all through his teachings:\n• “You lack one thing: go, sell all you have and give to the\npoor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me” (Mark 10:21).\n• “Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom\nof God. . . . But woe to you who are rich, for you have\nreceived your consolation” (Luke 6:20, 24).\n• “Any one of you who does not renounce all that he has\ncannot be my disciple” (Luke 14:33).\n• “It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle\nthan for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God” (Luke\n18:25).\n• “One’s life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions” (Luke 12:15).\n• “Seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and\nall these things will be added to you” (Matt. 6:33).\n• “Sell your possessions and give to the needy. Provide yourselves with moneybags . . . in the heavens” (Luke 12:33).\n• “Zacchaeus . . . said to the Lord, ‘Behold, Lord, the half\nof my goods I give to the poor. . . . ’ And Jesus said to him,\n‘Today salvation has come to this house’” (Luke 19:8–9).\n1. Randy Alcorn, The Treasure Principle (Sisters, OR: Multnomah, 2001), 8.\n\n[PAGE 104]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\n• “The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field,\nwhich a man found and covered up. Then in his joy he goes\nand sells all that he has and buys that field” (Matt. 13:44).\n• “[Jesus] saw a poor widow put in two small copper coins.\nAnd he said, ‘Truly, I tell you, this poor widow has put in\nmore than all of them’” (Luke 21:2–3).\n• “But God said to him, ‘Fool! This night your soul is required of you, and the things you have prepared, whose\nwill they be?’ So is the one who lays up treasure for himself\nand is not rich toward God” (Luke 12:20–21).\n• “Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the\nSon of Man has nowhere to lay his head. . . . Follow me”\n(Luke 9:58–59).\n\nHazardous Liberality\nOver and over Jesus is relentless in his radical call to a wartime\nlifestyle and a hazardous liberality. I say “hazardous” because\nof that story about the widow. She gave her last penny to the\ntemple ministry. Most of us would call her foolish or, more\ndelicately, imprudent. But there is not a word of criticism from\nJesus:\nAnd a poor widow came and put in two small copper coins,\nwhich make a penny. And he called his disciples to him and\nsaid to them, “Truly, I say to you, this poor widow has put in\nmore than all those who are contributing to the offering box.\nFor they all contributed out of their abundance, but she out of\nher poverty has put in everything she had, all she had to live\non.” (Mark 12:42–44)\n\nThe point here is not that everyone should give everything\naway. The point is: Jesus loves faith-filled risk for the glory of\nGod. I don’t have laws to give you concerning the particulars\nof how to spend your money, any more than Jesus did. I simply\nwant to point to Jesus and let his word have its shocking and\nsaving effect on us.\n\n\fLiving to Prove He Is More Precious Than Life\n\n[PAGE 105]\n\nUse Money to Show That God, Not\nPossessions, Is Our Treasure\nJesus’s emphasis on money and possessions is picked up throughout the New Testament. There are the stories in the book of Acts\n(“They were selling their possessions . . . and distributing the\nproceeds . . . as any had need,” Acts 2:45). There are the words\nof the apostle Paul (“In a severe test of affliction, their abundance\nof joy and their extreme poverty have overflowed in a wealth of\ngenerosity. . . . God loves a cheerful giver,” 2 Cor. 8:2; 9:7). There\nare the words of James, the brother of Jesus (“Its flower falls, and\nits beauty perishes. So also will the rich man fade away in the\nmidst of his pursuits,” James 1:11).\nThe issue is pervasive because it is crucial for the witness of\nthe church. If we want to make people glad in God, our lives must\nlook as if God, not possessions, is our joy. Our lives must look as\nif we use our possessions to make people glad in God—especially\nthe most needy.\n\nWhy I Use the Phrase “Wartime Lifestyle”\nSometimes I use the phrase “wartime lifestyle” or “wartime mindset.” The phrase is helpful—but also lopsided. For me it is mainly\nhelpful. It tells me that there is a war going on in the world between Christ and Satan, truth and falsehood, belief and unbelief.\nIt tells me that there are weapons to be funded and used, but that\nthese weapons are not swords or guns or bombs but the gospel\nand prayer and self-sacrificing love (2 Cor. 10:3–5). And it tells\nme that the stakes of this conflict are higher than any other war in\nhistory; they are eternal and infinite: heaven or hell, eternal joy or\neternal torment (Matt. 25:46).\nI need to hear this message again and again, because I drift into\na peacetime mind-set as certainly as rain falls down and flames\ngo up. I am wired by nature to love the same toys that the world\nloves. I start to fit in. I start to love what others love. I start to call\nearth “home.” Before you know it, I am calling luxuries “needs”\n\n[PAGE 106]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\nand using my money just the way unbelievers do. I begin to forget\nthe war. I don’t think much about people perishing. Missions and\nunreached peoples drop out of my mind. I stop dreaming about\nthe triumphs of grace. I sink into a secular mind-set that looks first\nto what man can do, not what God can do. It is a terrible sickness.\nAnd I thank God for those who have forced me again and again\ntoward a wartime mind-set.\n\nWhat It Looks like in Wartime\nI thank God for Ralph Winter, for example, who not only wrote\npowerfully about a wartime lifestyle, but has lived it as a missionary, professor, founder of the US Center for World Mission,\nand tireless advocate for the unreached peoples of the world.\nHe gave the following vivid illustration of the difference between a wartime and a peacetime mentality about the use of our\npossessions.\nThe Queen Mary, lying in repose in the harbor at Long Beach,\nCalifornia, is a fascinating museum of the past. Used both as\na luxury liner in peacetime and a troop transport during the\nSecond World War, its present status as a museum the length\nof three football fields affords a stunning contrast between\nthe lifestyles appropriate in peace and war. On one side of a\npartition you see the dining room reconstructed to depict the\npeacetime table setting that was appropriate to the wealthy\npatrons of high culture for whom a dazzling array of knives\nand forks and spoons held no mysteries. On the other side of\nthe partition the evidences of wartime austerities are in sharp\ncontrast. One metal tray with indentations replaces fifteen\nplates and saucers. Bunks, not just double but eight tiers high,\nexplain why the peace-time complement of 3000 gave way to\n15,000 people on board in wartime. How repugnant to the\npeacetime masters this transformation must have been! To\ndo it took a national emergency, of course. The survival of a\nnation depended on it. The essence of the Great Commission\n\n\fLiving to Prove He Is More Precious Than Life\n\n[PAGE 107]\n\ntoday is that the survival of many millions of people depends\non its fulfillment.2\n\nGiven the vulnerability of my heart to the seduction of the\npeacetime mind-set, which is pushed into my mind every day by\nmedia and entertainment, I need these images and these reminders.\nWe are at war, whether the stocks are falling or climbing, whether\nthe terrorists are hitting or hiding, whether we are healthy or sick.\nBoth pleasure and pain are laced with poison, ready to kill us\nwith the diseases of pride or despair. The repeated biblical warning to “be alert”3 fits the wartime image. And I need this warning\nevery day.\n\nWhy Not Speak of a “Simple Lifestyle”?\nIt is more helpful to think of a wartime lifestyle than a merely\nsimple lifestyle. Simplicity may have a romantic ring and a\ncertain aesthetic appeal that is foreign to the dirty business of\nmercy in the dangerous places of the world. Simplicity may also\noverlook the fact that, in wartime, major expenses for complex\nweapons and troop training are needed. These may not look\nsimple, and may be very expensive, but the whole country sacrifices to make them happen. Simplicity may be inwardly directed\nand may benefit no one else. A wartime lifestyle implies that\nthere is a great and worthy cause for which to spend and be\nspent (2 Cor. 12:15).\n\nWasting Life Means Losing Our Lives\nby Trying to Save Them\n“Being spent” may sound dour. It is not. It is life-giving when\nwe are spent to make others glad in God. Jesus taught us that\n2. Ralph Winter, “Reconsecration to a Wartime, Not a Peacetime, Lifestyle,” in Perspectives on the World Christian Movement: A Reader, ed. Ralph D. Winter and Steven C.\nHawthorne, 2nd ed. (Pasadena, CA: William Carey Library, 1999), 705.\n3. Matt. 24:42; 25:13; 26:41; Acts 20:31; 1 Cor. 16:13; Eph. 6:18; Col. 4:2; 1 Thess.\n5:6; 1 Pet. 5:8.\n\n[PAGE 108]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\n“whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life\nfor my sake and the gospel’s will save it” (Mark 8:35). This has\napplication to individuals on their way to heaven, and to cultures\non their way to extinction. Again Ralph Winter illustrates:\nAmerica today is a “save yourself” society if there ever was\none. But does it really work? The underdeveloped societies\nsuffer from one set of diseases: tuberculosis, malnutrition,\npneumonia, parasites, typhoid, cholera, typhus, etc. Affluent\nAmerica has virtually invented a whole new set of diseases:\nobesity, arteriosclerosis, heart disease, strokes, lung cancer,\nvenereal disease, cirrhosis of the liver, drug addiction, alcoholism, divorce, battered children, suicide, murder. Take your\nchoice. Labor-saving machines have turned out to be bodykilling devices. Our affluence has allowed both mobility and\nisolation of the nuclear family, and as a result, our divorce\ncourts, our prisons and our mental institutions are flooded. In\nsaving ourselves we have nearly lost ourselves.4\n\nUsing our possessions in a way that makes the most needy\nglad in God would save us in more ways than one. It would confirm that Christ is our Treasure, and thus keep us on the path to\nheaven. And it would transform our society, which is driven by the\nsuicidal craving to satisfy itself with no joy in Christ and no love\nfor the needy. To rescue us from this tragedy we should ponder\nseriously the importance of a wartime lifestyle.\n\nWartime at the Microbiological Level\nIn recent years Ralph Winter has waved another wartime flag.\nIt’s worth waving here. God may use it to send some of you in a\ndirection of ministry you never thought was ministry. Winter has\nbeen calling our attention to the effects of sin and Satan at the\nmicrobiological level where some of the most horrific devastation\nof God’s good creation happens.\n4. Winter, “Reconsecration to a Wartime, Not a Peacetime, Lifestyle,” 706.\n\n\fLiving to Prove He Is More Precious Than Life\n\n[PAGE 109]\n\nSatan has, horrifyingly, employed his rebellious freedom in the\ndevelopment of destructive germs and viruses at the microbial\nlevel, which today account for one third of all deaths on the\nplanet. What the Bible calls simply “pestilence,” is a scourge to\nanimals and humans alike. Yet our popular theology does not\nclearly recognize this as a work of Satan which God expects\nus to combat as part of His mission.\nBut, if missionaries do not preach about a God who is\ninterested in all suffering, all distortions of His creative handiwork, on all these levels we are simply misrepresenting the full\nscope of His pervasive love and concern—His very nature. . . .\nIn Vietnam ten Americans died every day on the average\nduring the entire ten years of that war. And, our government\npoured uncalculated billions into that conflict to extricate our\npeople from it.\nHowever, right now not ten but 1,500 Americans die every\nday of cancer. Yet our government truly puts only pennies in that\ndirection: 80% of it diverted to HIV/AIDS research, the 20% that\nends up in cancer research going almost entirely to evaluating\ntreatments not working toward prevention. I understand that all\n40 funded projects of the federal National Cancer Institute are\nfocused on chemo and radiation treatment, not prevention.\nIt’s like getting caught up in 150 Vietnam wars at the same\ntime—as far as battle deaths are concerned. And yet we act as\nthough no war exists! How can the consciousness of America\nbe aroused to the fact that one third of all women and half of\nall men will contract cancer before they die?5\n\nIt fully accords with the intention of this book that thousands\nof Christians would hear this challenge from Dr. Winter and give\ntheir lives in science and research, as well as medical missions,\n5. To clarify the relation between Satan’s freedom and God’s sovereignty, I would stress\nthat Satan is real and that God gives him permission (lengthening his leash, as it were) to\nexploit the divine curse on creation because of sin (Rom. 8:20–23), but that God remains in\ncontrol of the world in all of its parts. There is no contradiction between saying that God\nultimately controls all things and saying that we should labor to triumph over disease, resist\ninjustice, and win people to Christ. Our labor is part of his way of accomplishing his sovereign plan. See John Piper, “God’s Pleasure in All That He Does” (chap. 2), in The Pleasures of\nGod: Meditations on God’s Delight in Being God (Sisters, OR: Multnomah, 2000), 47–76.\n\n[PAGE 110]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\nto wage war against disease and suffering, and thus display the\nbeauty and power of Christ. What kinds of sacrifices should we\nmake for such combat with the enemy?\n\nWhen a Bobby Pin Mattered\nWe have seen the sacrifices that military people made in wartime\nduring World War II. But it wasn’t just the military that changed\nits priorities. The whole country did, just like the whole church\ncould today. During World War II,\nthe entire nation . . . seemed overnight to have snapped out\nof its Depression-era lethargy. Everyone scrambled to be of\nhelp. Rubber was needed for the war effort, and gasoline, and\nmetal. A women’s basketball game at Northwestern University\nwas stopped so that the referee and all ten players could scour\nthe floor for a lost bobby pin. Americans pitched in to support\nstrict rationing programs and their boys turned out as volunteers in various collection “drives.” Soon butter and milk were\nrestricted along with canned goods and meat. Shoes became\nscarce, and paper, and silk. People grew “victory gardens”\nand drove at the gas-saving “victory speed” of thirty-five miles\nan hour. “Use it up, wear it out, make it do, or do without?”\nbecame a popular slogan. Air-raid sirens and blackouts were\nscrupulously obeyed. America sacrificed.6\n\nSuch images are for me very powerful. Secondarily, they make\nme appreciate the benefits of freedom and prosperity. But primarily they rebuke me for my frivolous living and inspire me to\nmake my life count for something more than comfort and worldly\nsuccess—something God-exalting and eternal.\n\nYes, Yes, to Talk of War Is Lopsided\nBut I admit, as I said above, that the term “wartime lifestyle” or\n“wartime mind-set” is lopsided. After one sermon in which I used\n6. James Bradley, Flags of Our Fathers (New York: Bantam, 2000), 62.\n\n\fLiving to Prove He Is More Precious Than Life\n\n[PAGE 111]\n\nthese terms one person wrote to me and asked, “When you stress\nthe imagery of wartime living, do you leave any room for aspects\nof life that are not part of war, like art or leisure? Are there not\nother images of the Christian life that are more restful than war?”\nHere is the answer I gave in my next message:\nThe answer is, yes, absolutely, there are other images of the\nChristian life that are more restful. “The Lord is my Shepherd; I shall not want. He makes me lie down in green pastures. He leads me beside still waters” (Ps. 23:1–2). That is a\nvery different image than bombs dropping and blood flowing.\n“Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will\ngive you rest” (Matt. 11:28). “Even to your old age I am he,\nand to gray hairs I will carry you. I have made, and I will bear;\nI will carry and will save” (Isa. 46:4).\nAnd yes, there is a proper time and place for the Christian\nto benefit from, evaluate, and transform the whole range of\nhuman culture. In fact, it is virtually impossible not to be a\npart of our modern, Western culture; and if we do not think\nin terms of measured appropriation, biblical evaluation, and\nthoughtful transformation, we will probably be consumed by\nthe culture, and won’t even know that we are more American\nthan we are Christian.\nSo, yes, by all means, use all the images of Scripture (not\njust war) to shape your life. And then let your radically Christian, God-enthralled, Christ-treasuring, giving-oriented life\nengage and shape your culture.\n\nBut my sense is that in the prosperous West, the danger in the\nchurch is not that there are too many overly zealous people who\ncare too deeply about the lost, and invest hazardously in the cause\nof the gospel, and ruin their lives with excessive mercy to the poor.\nFor every careless saint who burns himself out and breaks up his\nfamily with misdirected zeal, I venture, there are a thousand who\ncoast with the world, treating Jesus like a helpful add-on, but not\nas an all-satisfying, all-authoritative King in the cause of love.\n\n[PAGE 112]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\nThe Ruinous Ethic of Mere Avoidance\nOne of the marks of this peacetime mind-set is what I call an avoidance ethic. In wartime we ask different questions about what to do\nwith our lives than we do in peacetime. We ask: What can I do to\nadvance the cause? What can I do to bring the victory? What sacrifice can I make or what risk can I take to insure the joy of triumph?\nIn peacetime we tend to ask, What can I do to be more comfortable?\nTo have more fun? To avoid trouble and, possibly, avoid sin?\nIf we are going to pay the price and take the risks it will cost\nto make people glad in God, we move beyond the avoidance\nethic. This way of life is utterly inadequate to waken people to\nthe beauty of Christ. Avoiding fearful trouble and forbidden behaviors impresses almost no one. The avoidance ethic by itself is\nnot Christ-commending or God-glorifying. There are many disciplined unbelievers who avoid the same behaviors Christians do.\nJesus calls us to something far more radical than that.\n\nThe Wrong Questions and the Right Ones\nPeople who are content with the avoidance ethic generally ask the\nwrong question about behavior. They ask, What’s wrong with it?\nWhat’s wrong with this movie? Or this music? Or this game? Or\nthese companions? Or this way of relaxing? Or this investment?\nOr this restaurant? Or shopping at this store? What’s wrong with\ngoing to the cabin every weekend? Or having a cabin? This kind\nof question will rarely yield a lifestyle that commends Christ as\nall-satisfying and makes people glad in God. It simply results in a\nlist of don’ts. It feeds the avoidance ethic.\nThe better questions to ask about possible behaviors is: How\nwill this help me treasure Christ more? How will it help me show\nthat I do treasure Christ? How will it help me know Christ or display Christ? The Bible says, “Whether you eat or drink, or whatever\nyou do, do all to the glory of God” (1 Cor. 10:31). So the question is\nmainly positive, not negative. How can I portray God as glorious in\nthis action? How can I enjoy making much of him in this behavior?\n\n\fLiving to Prove He Is More Precious Than Life\n\n[PAGE 113]\n\nClean Noses and Quality Family Time Is Not Life\nOh, how many lives are wasted by people who believe that the\nChristian life means simply avoiding badness and providing for\nthe family. So there is no adultery, no stealing, no killing, no embezzlement, no fraud—just lots of hard work during the day, and\nlots of TV and PG–13 videos in the evening (during quality family\ntime), and lots of fun stuff on the weekend—woven around church\n(mostly). This is life for millions of people. Wasted life. We were\ncreated for more, far more.\nThere is an old saying: “No man ever lamented on his dying\nbed, ‘I wish I had spent more time at the office.’” The point being\nmade is usually that when you are about to die, money suddenly\nlooks like what it really is, useless for lasting happiness, while\nrelationships become precious. It’s true. When my mother was\nkilled in 1974, I wrote to the chairman of my department at Bethel\nCollege, where I was teaching, and reversed my request to teach an\noverload the next semester to make more money. Standing beside\nyour mother’s grave with a wife and child makes things look different. Money loses its pull.\nBut that saying about spending less time at the office can be\nmisleading. We need to add this: No one will ever want to say to\nthe Lord of the universe five minutes after death, I spent every\nnight playing games and watching clean TV with my family because I loved them so much. I think the Lord will say, “That did\nnot make me look like a treasure in your town. You should have\ndone something besides provide for yourself and your family. And\nTV, as you should have known, was not a good way to nurture\nyour family or your own soul.”\n\nTelevision, the Great Life-Waster\nTelevision is one of the greatest life-wasters of the modern age.\nAnd, of course, the Internet is running to catch up, and may have\ncaught up. You can be more selective on the Internet, but you\ncan also select worse things with only the Judge of the universe\n\n[PAGE 114]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\nwatching. TV still reigns as the great life-waster. The main problem with TV is not how much smut is available, though that is a\nproblem. Just the ads are enough to sow fertile seeds of greed and\nlust, no matter what program you’re watching. The greater problem is banality. A mind fed daily on TV diminishes. Your mind\nwas made to know and love God. Its facility for this great calling\nis ruined by excessive TV. The content is so trivial and so shallow\nthat the capacity of the mind to think worthy thoughts withers,\nand the capacity of the heart to feel deep emotions shrivels. Neil\nPostman shows why.\nWhat is happening in America is that television is transforming all serious public business into junk. . . . Television disdains\nexposition, which is serious, sequential, rational, and complex. It offers instead a mode of discourse in which everything\nis accessible, simplistic, concrete, and above all, entertaining.\nAs a result, America is the world’s first culture in jeopardy of\namusing itself to death.7\n\nThe Weightlessness of God\nSince we all live in a world created by television, it is almost impossible to see what has happened to us. The only hope is to read\nwhat people were like in previous centuries. Biographies are a great\nantidote to cultural myopia and chronological snobbery. We have\nbecome almost incapable of handling any great truth reverently and\ndeeply. Magnificent things, especially the glory of God, as David\nWells says, rest with a kind of “weightlessness” even on the church.\nIt is one of the defining marks of Our Time that God is now\nweightless. I do not mean by this that he is ethereal but rather\nthat he has become unimportant. He rests upon the world so\ninconsequentially as not to be noticeable. He has lost his saliency for human life. Those who assure the pollsters of their\n7.

That is weightlessness. It is a condition we have assigned\nhim after having nudged him out to the periphery of our secularized life. . . . Weightlessness tells us nothing about God but\neverything about ourselves, about our condition, about our\npsychological disposition to exclude God from our reality.8\n\nSorting Out Sudan and Panty Hose\nWe have lost our ability to see and savor the complexities of truth\nand the depths of simplicity. Douglas Groothuis explains the connection between this weakness and television.\nThe triumph of the televised image over the word contributes\nto the depthlessness of postmodern sensibilities. . . . One cannot muse over a television program the way one ponders a\ncharacter in William Shakespeare or C. S. Lewis, or a Blaise\nPascal parable, or a line from a T. S. Eliot poem, such as ‘But\nour lot crawls between dry ribs / to keep its metaphysics\nwarm.’ No one on television could utter such a line seriously.\nIt would be “bad television”—too abstract, too poetic, too\ndeep, just not entertaining. . . . [Not only that] but the images\nappear and disappear and reappear without a proper rational\ncontext. An attempt at a sobering news story about slavery in\nthe Sudan is followed by a lively advertisement for Disneyland,\nfollowed by an appeal to purchase panty hose that will make\nany woman irresistible, etc., ad nauseum.9\n\nTherefore the man who stands before God with his well-kept\navoidance ethic and his protest that he did not spend too much\n8.

Groothuis, “How the Bombarding Images of TV Culture Undermine the\nPower of Words,” Modern Reformation 10 (January/February 2001): 35–36.\n\n[PAGE 116]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\ntime at the office but came home and watched TV with his family\nwill probably not escape the indictment that he wasted his life.\nJesus rebuked his disciples with words that easily apply to this\nman: “Even sinners work hard, avoid gross sin, watch TV at night,\nand do fun stuff on the weekend. What more are you doing than\nthe others?” (see Luke 6:32–34; Matt. 5:47).\n\nInspiring Sacrifice for Lesser Causes\nIn fact, in wartime sinners often rise to remarkable levels of sacrifice for causes that cannot compare with Christ. The greatest\ncause in the world is joyfully rescuing people from hell, meeting\ntheir earthly needs, making them glad in God, and doing it with\na kind, serious pleasure that makes Christ look like the Treasure\nhe is. No war on earth was ever fought for a greater cause or a\ngreater king.\nBut oh, what bold risks and daring sacrifices these lesser causes\nhave inspired! On February 19, 1945, the battle for Iwo Jima\nbegan. It was a barren, eight-mile-square island six hundred miles\nsouth of Tokyo, guarded by 22,000 Japanese prepared to fight to\nthe death (which they did). They were protecting two air strips\nthat America needed in the strategic effort to contain Japanese aggression after Pearl Harbor and preserve the liberty that America\ncherished. It was a high cause, and the courageous sacrifice was\nstunning.\nThe hard statistics show the sacrifice made by Colonel Johnson’s 2nd Battalion: 1,400 boys [many still teenagers] landed\non D-Day; 288 replacements were provided as the battle\nwent on, a total of 1,688. Of these, 1,511 had been killed\nor wounded. Only 177 walked off the island. And of the\nfinal 177, 91 had been wounded at least once and returned\nto battle.\nIt had taken twenty-two crowded transports to bring the\n5th Division to the island. The survivors fit comfortably onto\neight departing ships.\n\n\fLiving to Prove He Is More Precious Than Life\n\n[PAGE 117]\n\nThe American boys had killed about 21,000 Japanese, but\nsuffered more than 26,000 casualties doing so. This would be\nthe only battle in the Pacific where the invaders suffered higher\ncasualties than the defenders.\nThe Marines fought in World War II for forty-three\nmonths. Yet in one month on Iwo Jima, one third of their total\ndeaths occurred. They left behind the Pacific’s largest cemeteries: nearly 6,800 graves in all; mounds with their crosses and\nstars. Thousands of families would not have the solace of a\nbody to bid farewell: just the abstract information that the\nMarine had “died in the performance of his duty” and was\nburied in a plot, aligned in a row with numbers on his grave.\nMike lay in Plot 3, Row 5, Grave 694; Harlon in Plot 4, Row\n6, Grave 912; Franklin in Plot 8, Row 7, Grave 2189.\nWhen I think of Mike, Harlon, and Franklin there, I think\nof the message someone had chiseled outside the cemetery:\nWhen you go home\nTell them for us and say\nFor your tomorrow\nWe gave our today.10\n\nOh, Lord, Don’t Let Me Waste My Life!\nI am deeply moved by the courage and carnage on Iwo Jima. As\nI read the pages of this history, everything in me cries out, “Oh,\nLord, don’t let me waste my life!” Let me come to the end—\nwhether soon or late—and be able to say to a family, a church, a\ncity, and the unreached peoples of the earth, “For your tomorrow,\nI gave my today. Not just for your tomorrow on earth, but for the\ncountless tomorrows of your ever-increasing gladness in God.”\nThe closer I looked at the individual soldiers in this World War\nII history, the more I felt a passion that my life would count, and\nthat I would be able to die well.\n10. Bradley, Flags of Our Fathers, 246–47. This book is the story of the Battle of Iwo\nJima woven together with the lives of the six flag raisers in the famous Iwo Jima Memorial,\ntold by the son of John Bradley, one of the soldiers in the Memorial.\n\n[PAGE 118]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\nAs rainy morning wore into afternoon and the fighting bogged\ndown, the Marines continued to take casualties. Often it was\nthe corpsmen [medics] themselves who died as they tried to\npreserve life. William Hoopes of Chattanooga was crouching beside a medic named Kelly, who put his head above a\nprotective ridge and placed binoculars to his eyes—just for\nan instant—to spot a sniper who was peppering his area. In\nthat instant the sniper shot him through the Adam’s apple.\nHoopes, a pharmacist’s mate himself, struggled frantically to\nsave his friend. “I took my forceps and reached into his neck\nto grasp the artery and pinch it off,” Hoopes recalled. “His\nblood was spurting. He had no speech but his eyes were on\nme. He knew I was trying to save his life. I tried everything\nin the world. I couldn’t do it. I tried. The blood was so slippery. I couldn’t get the artery. I was trying so hard. And all\nthe while he just looked at me. He looked directly into my\nface. The last thing he did as the blood spurts became less and\nless was to pat me on the arm as if to say, ‘That’s all right.’\nThen he died.”11\n\nIn this heart-breaking moment I want to be Hoopes and I want\nto be Kelly. I want to be able to say to suffering and perishing\npeople, “I tried everything in the world. . . . I was trying so hard.”\nAnd I want to be able to say to those around me when I die, “It’s\nall right. To live is Christ, and to die is gain.”\n\nWhen the Trifling Fog Clears\nAt these moments, when the trifling fog of life clears and I see\nwhat I am really on earth to do, I groan over the petty pursuits\nthat waste so many lives—and so much of mine. Just think of the\nmagnitude of sports—a whole section of the daily newspaper.\nBut there is no section on God. Think of the endless resources for\nmaking your home and garden more comfortable and impressive.\nThink of how many tens of thousands of dollars you can spend\n11. Ibid., 188.\n\n\fLiving to Prove He Is More Precious Than Life\n\n[PAGE 119]\n\nto buy more car than you need. Think of the time and energy and\nconversation that go into entertainment and leisure and what we\ncall “fun stuff.” And add to that now the computer that artificially\nrecreates the very games that are already so distant from reality;\nit is like a multi-layered dreamworld of insignificance expanding\ninto nothingness.\n\nConsumed with Clothes\nOr think about clothes. What a tragedy to see so many young\npeople obsessed with what they wear and how they look. Even\nChristian youth seem powerless to ask greater questions than\n“What’s wrong with it?” Like: Will these clothes help me magnify\nChrist? Will they point people to him as the manifest Treasure of\nmy life? Will they highlight my personhood, created in the image\nof God to serve, or will they highlight my sexuality? Or my laziness? Trust me, I’m not hung up on clothes. There are some\npretty radical, Christ-exalting reasons to dress down. My plea is\nthat you be more like a dolphin and less like a jellyfish in the sea\nof fashion—and of contra-fashion (which is just as tyrannizing).\nGo beyond one teenager who wrote to the Minneapolis Star\nTribune in response to a letter to the editor:\nAs a teenager, what you wear is unfortunately becoming more\nimportant. Honestly even I find some of the clothes that I wear\noffensive. The letter spoke of girls being able to dress fashionably and sensibly. Show me how that’s possible, and I’ll do it.\nMost of my friends often are not comfortable with what\nis popular, but we wear it anyway. Standing out is just not\nalways worth the struggle. Society tells us to be different, yet\nmainstream.\nHow do you dress to please yourself, your parents and\nyour peers? You can’t. Teens end up compromising their values\nto fit in. If we intend to make it through high school, or even\njunior high, without being tormented then we must dress to\nplease our peers.\n\n[PAGE 120]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\nWe are the up-and-coming leaders of this nation, and we\nmust see what we have become and change.12\n\nWhere Are the Young Radicals for Christ?\nWhen I stand, as it were, on the shores of Iwo Jima and let myself\nreenact those hours of courage and sacrifice, and remember that\nthey were young, I cannot make peace with the petty preoccupations of most American life. One of them was really young. I read\nhis story and wanted to speak to every youth group in America\nand say, Do you want to see what cool is? Do you want to see\nsomething a thousand times more impressive than a triple double?\nWell, listen up about Jacklyn Lucas.\nHe’d fast-talked his way into the Marines at fourteen, fooling\nthe recruits with his muscled physique. . . . Assigned to drive a\ntruck in Hawaii, he had grown frustrated; he wanted to fight.\nHe stowed away on a transport out of Honolulu, surviving on\nfood passed along to him by sympathetic leathernecks on board.\nHe landed on D-Day [at Iwo Jima] without a rifle. He\ngrabbed one lying on the beach and fought his way inland.\nNow, on D+1, Jack and three comrades were crawling\nthrough a trench when eight Japanese sprang in front of them.\nJack shot one of them through the head. Then his rifle jammed.\nAs he struggled with it a grenade landed at his feet. He yelled\na warning to the others and rammed the grenade into the soft\nash. Immediately, another rolled in. Jack Lucas, seventeen, fell\non both grenades. “Luke, you’re gonna die,” he remembered\nthinking. . . .\nAboard the hospital ship Samaritan the doctors could scarcely\nbelieve it. “Maybe he was too damned young and too damned\ntough to die,” one said. He endured twenty-one reconstructive\noperations and became the nation’s youngest Medal of Honor\nwinner—and the only high school freshman to receive it.13\n12.

I sat on the porch where I was reading and thought,\nOh, God, who will get in their face and give them something to\nlive for? They waste their days in a trance of insignificance, trying to look cool or talk cool or walk cool. They don’t have a clue\nwhat cool is.\nOne more story to clarify what is cool. It’s about Ray Dollins,\na fighter pilot at Iwo Jima.\nThe first wave of amtracs headed for shore. The Marine fighter\nplanes were finishing up their low strafing runs. And as the last\npilot began to pull his Corsair aloft, Japanese sprang to their\nguns and riddled the plane with flak. The pilot, Major Ray\nDollins, tried to gain altitude as he headed out over the ocean\nso as to avoid a deadly crash into the Marines headed for the\nbeach, but his plane was too badly damaged. Lieutenant Keith\nWells watched it from the amtrac. . . . “We could see him in\nthe cockpit,” Wells said, “and he was trying everything. He\nwas heading straight down for a group of approaching ’tracs\nfilled with Marines. At the last second he flipped the plane over\non its back and aimed it into the water between two waves of\ntanks. We watched the water exploding into the air.”\nMilitary personnel listening to the flight radio network\nfrom the ships could not only see Dollins go down; they could\nhear his last words into his microphone. They were a defiant\nparody.\nOh, what a beautiful morning,\nOh, what a beautiful day,\nI’ve got a terrible feeling\nEverything’s coming my way.14\n\nOf course, we do not use the word cool to describe true\ngreatness. It is a small word. That’s the point. It’s cheap. And\nit’s what millions of young people live for. Who confronts them\n14. Ibid., 161–62.\n\n[PAGE 122]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\nwith urgency and tears? Who pleads with them not to waste their\nlives? Who takes them by the collar, so to speak, and loves them\nenough to show them a life so radical and so real and so costly\nand Christ-saturated that they feel the emptiness and triviality of\ntheir CD collection and their pointless conversations about passing celebrities? Who will waken what lies latent in their souls,\nuntapped—a longing not to waste their lives?\n\nMy Heart’s Plea\nOh, that young and old would turn off the television, take a long\nwalk, and dream about feats of courage for a cause ten thousand\ntimes more important than American democracy—as precious as\nthat is. If we would dream and if we would pray, would not God\nanswer? Would he withhold from us a life of joyful love and mercy\nand sacrifice that magnifies Christ and makes people glad in God?\nI plead with you, as I pray for myself, set your face like flint to\njoin Jesus on the Calvary road. “Let us go to him outside the camp\nand bear the reproach he endured. For here we have no lasting\ncity, but we seek the city that is to come” (Heb. 13:13–14). When\nthey see our sacrificial love—radiant with joy—will they not say,\n“Christ is great”?\n\n\f8\n\nMaking Much of\nChrist from 8 to 5\n\nIt would be a mistake to infer from the call to wartime living in\nthe previous chapter that Christians should quit their jobs and\ngo to “war”—say, to become missionaries or pastors or full-time\nrelief workers. That would be a fundamental misunderstanding\nof where the war is being fought. Of course, the battles are raging\nspiritually (without bombs or bayonets) among unreached peoples\nof the world where the King of kings has sent his selfless “troops”\nwith the gospel of peace and is gathering a happy people for himself. This is the glorious work of frontier missions. I will argue\nlater that it is a magnificent calling; and I pray that thousands of\nyou who read this book will hear it and go to those front lines.\n\nThe War Is Not Geographical\nBut make no mistake, the “war” that I have in mind when I speak\nof a “wartime mind-set” or a “wartime lifestyle” is not being\nfought along geographical lines. It is being fought first along the\nline between good and evil in every human heart, especially the\nhearts of Christians where Christ has staked his claim, and where\n\n[PAGE 124]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\nhe means to be totally triumphant. The “war” is being fought\nalong the line between sin and righteousness in every family. It is\nbeing fought along the line between truth and falsehood in every\nschool . . . between justice and injustice in every legislature . . .\nbetween integrity and corruption in every office . . . between love\nand hate in every ethnic group . . . between pride and humility in\nevery sport . . . between the beautiful and the ugly in every art . . .\nbetween right doctrine and wrong doctrine in every church . . .\nand between sloth and diligence between coffee breaks. It is not\na waste to fight the battle for truth and faith and love on any of\nthese fronts.\nThe war is not primarily spatial or physical—though its successes and failures have physical effects. Therefore, the secular\nvocations of Christians are a war zone. There are spiritual adversaries to be defeated (that is, evil spirits and sins, not people); and\nthere is beautiful moral high ground to be gained for the glory\nof God. You don’t waste you life by where you work, but how\nand why.\n\nSecular Is Not Bad, but Strategic\nPlease don’t hear in the phrase “secular vocation” any unspiritual\nor inferior comparison to “church vocation” or “mission vocation” or “spiritual vocation.” I simply mean the vocations that are\nnot structurally connected to the church. There is such a thing as\nbeing in the world but not of the world, as Jesus taught when he\nprayed in John 17:15–16, “I do not ask that you take them out of\nthe world, but that you keep them from the evil one. They are not\nof the world, just as I am not of the world.” So Jesus’s intention\nis that his disciples remain in the world (which is what I mean by\n“secular jobs”), but that they not be “of the world” (which is why\nI say we are in a war).\nMartin Luther recaptured the biblical teaching of the priesthood of every Christian and blasted the spiritual line between\nclergy and laity. He agreed that there is a church calling and a\n\n\fMaking Much of Christ from 8 to 5 125\n\nsecular calling. But his way of distinguishing them was not based\non any superior “spiritual estate.”\nIt is pure invention that pope, bishops, priests and monks are\nto be called the “spiritual estate”; princes, lords, artisans and\nfarmers the “temporal estate.” That is indeed a fine bit of lying\nand hypocrisy. . . . All Christians are truly of the “spiritual\nestate,” and there is among them no difference at all but that\nof office. . . . To make it still clearer. If a little group of pious\nChristian laymen were taken captive and set down in a wilderness, and had among them no priest consecrated by a bishop,\nand if there in the wilderness they were to agree in choosing\none of themselves, married or unmarried, and were to charge\nhim with the office of baptizing, saying mass, absolving and\npreaching, such a man would be as truly a priest as though all\nbishops and popes had consecrated him. . . . There is really no\ndifference between laymen and priests, princes and bishops,\n“spirituals” and “temporals,” as they call them, except that\nof office and work. . . . A cobbler, a smith, a farmer, each has\nthe work and office of his trade, and yet they are all alike\nconsecrated priests and bishops, and everyone by means of his\nown work or office must benefit and serve every other, that in\nthis way many kinds of work may be done for the bodily and\nspiritual welfare of the community, even as all the members of\nthe body serve one another.1\n\nThe Bible makes it plain that God’s will is for his people to\nbe scattered like salt and light among the whole range of secular vocations. Enclaves of Christians living only with Christians\nand working only with Christians would not accomplish God’s\nwhole purpose in the world. That does not mean Christian orders\nor ministries or mission outposts are wrong. It means they are\n1. Martin Luther, “An Open Letter to the Christian Nobility,” in Three Treatises (Philadelphia, PA: Fortress, 1960), 14–17. See Gene Edward Veith Jr., God at Work: Your Christian Vocation in All of Life (Wheaton, IL: Crossway, 2002) for an exposition for laypeople\nof Luther’s doctrine of vocation. See also Os Guinness, The Call: Finding and Fulfilling the\nCentral Purpose of Your Life (Nashville: Word, 1998), and Paul Helm, Callings: The Gospel\nin the World (Edinburgh: Banner of Truth, 1998).\n\n[PAGE 126]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\nexceptional. The vast majority of Christians are meant to live in\nthe world and work among unbelievers. This is their “office,” their\n“calling,” as Luther would say. We will see why this is God’s will\nin a moment.\n\nPartnership of Ox and People\nNot everyone should be a missionary or a pastor. There is to be\na partnership between goers and senders. Concerning pastors in\nthe church Paul says, “You shall not muzzle an ox when it treads\nout the grain” (1 Tim. 5:18), meaning: pay your pastor. But that\nimplies that some folks must be earning grain to put under the\npoor ox’s nose. This is also the pattern for missionaries in the\nNew Testament. “Do your best to speed Zenas the lawyer and\nApollos on their way; see that they lack nothing” (Titus 3:13). In\nother words, not everybody should go to minister with Paul; some\nshould stay behind, work, and supply the ones who go. Similarly\nPaul planned for the Roman church to be his supply base as he\nheaded for Spain: “I hope to see you in passing as I go to Spain,\nand to be helped on my journey there by you, once I have enjoyed\nyour company for a while” (Rom. 15:24).\nHe assumed they would be gainfully employed so they could\ngive. That’s why he said to the Thessalonian believers, “Work\nwith your hands . . . so that you may . . . be dependent on no\none” (1 Thess. 4:11–12). In fact, Paul was so provoked by the\nidle busybodies in Thessalonica that he wrote in a second letter:\nWe were not idle when we were with you, nor did we eat anyone’s bread without paying for it, but with toil and labor we\nworked night and day, that we might not be a burden to any\nof you. . . . If anyone is not willing to work, let him not eat.\nFor we hear that some among you walk in idleness, not busy\nat work, but busybodies. (2 Thess. 3:7–11)\n\nSimilarly, he said to the Ephesians, “Let the thief no longer steal,\nbut rather let him labor, doing honest work with his own hands,\n\n\fMaking Much of Christ from 8 to 5 127\n\nso that he may have something to share with anyone in need”\n(Eph. 4:28).\n\nStay in Your Job “with God”\nThe call to be a Christian was not a call to leave your secular vocation. That’s the clear point of 1 Corinthians 7:17–24. Paul sums\nup his teaching there with these words: “So, brothers, in whatever\ncondition each was called, there let him remain with God” (v. 24).\nPaul had a high view of the providence of God—that God had\nsovereignly “assigned” or “called” unbelievers to positions in life\nwhere their conversion would have significant impact for his glory.\n“Only let each person lead the life that the Lord has assigned to\nhim, and to which God has called him” (v. 17). Paul does not\nmean that changing jobs is wrong in the Christian life—otherwise\nno one could become a vocational pastor or missionary except\nvery young people (unlike Jesus who changed from carpentry to\nfull-time ministry when he was thirty, Luke 3:23). What Paul does\nmean is that when we are converted we should not jump to the\nconclusion, my job must change. Rather our thought should be,\nGod has put me here, and I should now display his worth in this\njob. As verse 24 says, “there let him remain with God.”\nTherefore, the burning question for most Christians should\nbe: How can my life count for the glory of God in my secular\nvocation? I am assuming from all that has been said in this book\nso far that the aim of life is the same, whether in a secular vocation or in a church or mission vocation. Our aim is to joyfully\nmagnify Christ—to make him look great by all we do. Boasting\nonly in the cross, our aim is to enjoy making much of him by the\nway we work. The question is, How? The Bible points to at least\nsix answers.\n1. We can make much of God in our secular job through the fellowship that we enjoy with him throughout the day in all our work.\nIn other words, we enjoy God’s being there for us as we listen\n\n[PAGE 128]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\nto his voice, and talk to him, and cast all our burdens on him,\nand experience his guidance and care. The biblical pointer to this\ntruth is 1 Corinthians 7:24. When you are converted, stay in your\njob and enjoy God’s presence. “In whatever condition each was\ncalled, there let him remain with God.” These last two words are\nimportant. Christians do not just go to work. They go to work\n“with God.” They do not just do a job. They do their job “with\nGod.” God is with them.\nA More Personal Promise\nThis is not the same as the general promises made to the church as\na whole. God promises to the church corporately, “I will make my\ndwelling among them and walk among them, and I will be their\nGod, and they shall be my people” (2 Cor. 6:16). The promise for\nyou in your secular job is different. When the saints are at work\nin their secular employment, they are scattered. They are not together in church. So the command to “remain there with God”\nis a promise that you may know God’s fellowship personally and\nindividually on the job.\nBreathing Out Continual Thanks to God for All Things\nOne way to enjoy God’s presence and fellowship is through thankful awareness that your ability to do any work at all, including this\nwork, is owing to his grace. “He himself gives to all mankind life and\nbreath and everything” (Acts 17:25). All your faculties of sight and\nhearing and touch, all your motor skills with hands and legs, all your\nmental acts of observing and organizing and assessing, all your skills\nthat make you good at this particular job—all these things are God’s\ngifts. To know this can fill you with a sense of continual thankfulness offered up to God in prayer. “I give thanks to you, O Lord my\nGod, with my whole heart, and I will glorify your name forever”\n(Ps. 86:12). Sometimes the wonder of who God is will rise up in us\nwhile we work, and we will whisper his praise: “Bless the Lord, O\nmy soul! O Lord my God, you are very great!” (Ps. 104:1).\n\n\fMaking Much of Christ from 8 to 5 129\n\nWhen you add to this the awareness that you depend on God\nfor every future minute of life and for all the help you need, your\nthankfulness flows over into faith for each upcoming moment and\nfor the remainder of the day and week and month and year and\ndecade. This is faith in future grace. It can be expressed in prayer\nto God with biblical words like, “I trust in you, O Lord; I say,\n‘You are my God’” (Ps. 31:14). Or you can say, “Your steadfast\nlove never ceases; your mercies never come to an end; they are new\nevery morning (and every afternoon!); great is your faithfulness!”\n(paraphrase of Lam. 3:22–23).\nTaking the Promises to Work\nSupporting this thankfulness and praise and trust are the promises of God that you can take to work every day—written in your\nBible or memorized in your head. This is the way God speaks to\nyou through the day. He encourages you, “Fear not, for I am with\nyou; be not dismayed, for I am your God; I will strengthen you,\nI will help you, I will uphold you with my righteous right hand”\n(Isa. 41:10). He reminds you that the challenges of the afternoon\nare not too hard for him to manage: “Behold, I am the Lord, the\nGod of all flesh. Is anything too hard for me?” (Jer. 32:27). He tells\nyou not to be anxious, but to ask him for whatever you need (Phil.\n4:6), and says, “Cast all your anxieties on me, for I care for you”\n(paraphrase of 1 Pet. 5:7). And he promises to guide you through\nthe day: “I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should\ngo; I will counsel you with my eye upon you” (Ps. 32:8).\nIn this way we fellowship with God, listening to him through\nhis Word and thanking him and praising him and calling on him\nfor all we need. It is an honor to God if you stay in your secular\njob “with God” in this way. This is not a wasted life. God delights\nin being trusted and enjoyed. It shows his value. And when we\nremind ourselves that none of these undeserved blessings could be\nours apart from the death of Christ in our place, every heartbeat\nof joy in God becomes a boasting in the cross.\n\n[PAGE 130]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\n2. We make much of Christ in our secular work by the joyful,\ntrusting, God-exalting design of our creativity and industry.\nIt is helpful to ask how human beings differ from beavers and\nhummingbirds and spiders and ants. It helps get at the essence\nof how humans honor God with their work. These creatures are\nvery hard workers and make very intricate and amazing things. So\nthere must be more to our God-honoring work than such creativity and industry—unless we are willing to say that we glorify God\nwith our work no differently than the animals.\nDeputies of God Subduing the Earth for His Glory\nWhat’s the difference? Consider the first biblical words about\nman’s creation. “So God created man in his own image, in the\nimage of God he created him; male and female he created them.\nAnd God blessed them. And God said to them, ‘Be fruitful and\nmultiply and fill the earth and subdue it and have dominion over\nthe fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over\nevery living thing that moves on the earth’” (Gen. 1:27–28). Our\ncreation in God’s image leads directly to our privilege and duty\nto subdue the earth and have dominion over it. In other words,\nwe should be busy understanding and shaping and designing and\nusing God’s creation in a way that calls attention to his worth and\nwakens worship.\nBeing in the image of God means at least that we should image\nforth God. We should reflect what he is really like. And we should\ndo that not to make ourselves look great (as imagers) but to make\nhim look great (as Creator). People make images of famous people\nto honor them. God made man in his own image so that he would\nbe seen and enjoyed and honored through what man does.\nThen he said, first of all, that what man does is work. He subdues and takes dominion over the earth. This implies that part of\nwhat it means to be human is to exercise lordship over creation\nand give the world shape and order and design that reflects the\ntruth and beauty of God. God makes man, so to speak, his rul-\n\n\fMaking Much of Christ from 8 to 5 131\n\ning deputy and endows him with God-like rights and capacities\nto subdue the world—to use it and shape it for good purposes,\nespecially the purpose of magnifying the Creator.\nWork Is Not a Curse; Futility Is\nSo if you go all the way back, before the origin of sin, there are no\nnegative connotations about secular work. According to Genesis\n2:2, God himself rested from his work of creation, implying that\nwork is a good, God-like thing. And the capstone of that divine\nwork was man, a creature in God’s own image designed to carry\non the work of ruling and shaping and designing creation. Therefore, at the heart of the meaning of work is creativity. If you are\nGod, your work is to create out of nothing. If you are not God, but\nlike God—that is, if you are human—your work is to take what\nGod has made and shape it and use it to make him look great.\nHow We Differ from Beavers\nBut here is where the beavers come in. A beaver subdues his surroundings and shapes a dam for a good purpose, a house. He\nseems to enjoy his work; and even the diligence and skill of the\nbeaver reflects the glory of God’s wisdom.\nAll things bright and beautiful,\nAll creatures great and small,\nAll things wise and wonderful,\nThe Lord God made them all.2\n\nAnd God is glorified in them all. “Let the rivers clap their\nhands . . . the hills sing for joy . . . [and] the heavens declare the\nglory of God” (Ps. 98:8; 19:1). So what is the difference between a\nhuman being at work and a beaver at work? Or for that matter, a\nbee or a hummingbird or an ant? They all work hard; they subdue\ntheir surroundings and shape them into amazing structures that\n2. Cecil F. Alexander, “All Things Bright and Beautiful” (1848).\n\n[PAGE 132]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\nserve good purposes. The difference is that humans are morally\nself-conscious and make choices about their work on the basis of\nmotives that may or may not honor God.\nNo beaver or bee or hummingbird or ant consciously relies on\nGod. No beaver ponders the divine pattern of order and beauty\nand makes a moral choice to pursue excellence because God is\nexcellent. No beaver ever pondered the preciousness and purpose\nof God and decided for God’s sake to make a dam for another\nbeaver and not for himself. But humans have all these potentials,\nbecause we are created in God’s image. We are created to image\nforth God in these ways. When God commissions us to subdue\nthe earth—to shape it and use it—he doesn’t mean do it like a\nbeaver. He means do it like a human, a morally self-conscious\nperson who is responsible to do his work intentionally for the\nglory of his Maker.\nTo be sure, when God sends us forth to work as his imagebearers, our ditches are to be dug straight, our pipe-fittings are\nnot to leak, our cabinet corners should be flush, our surgical\nincisions should be clean, our word processing accurate and appealing, and our meals nutritious and attractive, because God is\na God of order and beauty and competence. But cats are clean,\nand ants are industrious, and spiders produce orderly and beautiful works. And all of them are dependent on God. Therefore, the\nessence of our work as humans must be that it is done in conscious reliance on God’s power, and in conscious quest of God’s\npattern of excellence, and in deliberate aim to reflect God’s glory.\nDoing Good Work and Sleeping Well\nWhen you work like this—no matter what your vocation is—you\ncan have a sweet sense of peace at the end of the day. It has not\nbeen wasted. God has not created us to be idle. Therefore, those\nwho abandon creative productivity lose the joy of God-dependent,\nworld-shaping, God-reflecting purposeful work. “Sweet is the\nsleep of a laborer, whether he eats little or much, but the full\n\n\fMaking Much of Christ from 8 to 5 133\n\nstomach of the rich will not let him sleep” (Eccles. 5:12). Jonathan\nEdwards made it a rule that personal piety to the neglect of secular\nduties is hypocritical. He described his own wife (“the person”) to\nillustrate the opposite:\n“Oh how good,” said the person once, “it is to work for God\nin the daytime, and at night to lie down under his smiles!”\nHigh experiences and religious affections in this person have\nnot been attended with any disposition at all to neglect the\nnecessary business of a secular calling, to spend time in reading and prayer, and other exercises of devotion; but worldly\nbusiness has been attended with great alacrity, as part of the\nservice of God; the person declaring that it being done thus,\n“’tis found to be as good as prayer.”3\n\nTrue personal piety feeds the purposeful work of secular vocations rather than undermining it. Idleness does not grow in the\nsoil of fellowship with God. Therefore, people who spend their\nlives mainly in idleness or frivolous leisure are rarely as happy as\nthose who work. Retired people who are truly happy have sought\ncreative, useful, God-honoring ways to stay active and productive\nfor the sake of man’s good and God’s glory.\nTo be sure, we should help each other find and keep work. We\nshould care about the larger problem of unemployment. It is not\nfirst an economic problem, though it is that. It is first a theological problem. Human beings are created in the image of God and\nare endowed with traits of their Creator that fit them for creative,\nuseful, joyful, God-exalting work. Therefore, extensive idleness\n(when you have the ability to work) brings down the oppression\nof guilt and futility.\nSo the second way we make much of God in our secular work\nis through the joyful, trusting, God-exalting design of our creativity and industry. God created us for work so that by consciously\n3. Jonathan Edwards, “Thoughts Concerning the Revival,” in The Great Awakening, ed.\nC. C. Goen, vol. 4 of The Works of Jonathan Edwards (New Haven, CT: Yale University\nPress, 1972), 340.\n\n[PAGE 134]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\nrelying on his power and consciously shaping the world after his\nexcellence, we might be satisfied in him, and he might be glorified\nin us. And when we remember that all this God-exalting creativity and all this joy is only possible for undeserving sinners like\nus because of the death of Christ, every hour of labor becomes a\nboasting in the cross.\n3. We make much of Christ in our secular work when it confirms\nand enhances the portrait of Christ’s glory that people hear in the\nspoken gospel.\nThere is no point in overstating the case for the value of secular\nwork. It is not the gospel. By itself, it does not save anyone. In fact,\nwith no spoken words about Jesus Christ, our secular work will\nnot awaken wonder for the glory of Christ. That is why the New\nTestament modestly calls our work an adornment of the gospel.\nIn addressing slaves, Paul says they are “to be well-pleasing, not\nargumentative, not pilfering, but showing all good faith, so that\nin everything they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior”\n(Titus 2:9–10). The point here is not to endorse slavery (which\nPaul undermined more indirectly by calling the converted slave,\nOnesimus, “no longer . . . a slave but . . . a beloved brother,”\nPhilem. 16), but to show that the way we do our work “adorns”\nthe doctrine of God.\nIn other words, our work is not the beautiful woman, but\nthe necklace. The beautiful woman is the gospel—“the doctrine\nof God our Savior.” So one crucial meaning of our secular work\nis that the way we do it will increase or decrease the attractiveness of the gospel we profess before unbelievers. Of course, the\ngreat assumption is that they know we are Christians. The whole\npoint of the text breaks down if there is nothing for our work to\n“adorn.” Thinking that our work will glorify God when people\ndo not know we are Christians is like admiring an effective ad on\nTV that never mentions the product. People may be impressed but\nwon’t know what to buy.\n\n\fMaking Much of Christ from 8 to 5 135\n\nRemoving Stumbling Blocks for Faith\nThere is another place where Paul expresses the modest role of\nour work in relation to the gospel. In 1 Thessalonians 4:11 he\ntells the church, “Aspire to live quietly, and to mind your own affairs, and to work with your hands, as we instructed you, so that\nyou may walk properly before outsiders and be dependent on no\none.” The point here is not that our work will save anyone. The\npoint is that if we live and work well, obstacles will be removed.\nIn other words, good, honest work is not the saving gospel of God,\nbut a crooked Christian car salesmen is a blemish on the gospel\nand puts a roadblock in the way of seeing the beauty of Christ.\nAnd sloth may be a greater stumbling block than crime. Should\nChristians be known in their offices as the ones you go to if you\nhave a problem, but not the ones to go to with a complex professional issue? It doesn’t have to be either-or. The biblical mandate\nis: “Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for\nmen” (Col. 3:23; cf. Eph. 6:7).\nSo the third way we make much of God in our secular work\nis by having such high standards of excellence and such integrity\nand such manifest goodwill that we put no obstacles in the way\nof the gospel but rather call attention to the all-satisfying beauty\nof Christ. When we adorn the gospel with our work, we are not\nwasting our lives. And when we call to mind that the adornment\nitself (our God-dependent, God-shaped, God-exalting work) was\npurchased for us by the blood of Christ, and that the beauty we\nadorn is itself the gospel of Christ’s death, then all our tender\nadornment becomes a boasting in the cross.\n4. We make much of Christ in our secular work by earning enough\nmoney to keep us from depending on others, while focusing on the\nhelpfulness of our work rather than financial rewards.\nGod intended from the beginning that satisfying work would provide for our needs. God worked at the beginning (Gen. 2:2), and\nthe humans he created in his image would work. Before sin entered\n\n[PAGE 136]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\nthe world, that work would be without futility and frustration. It\nwould unite beautifully with God’s abundant provision to meet\nevery need. It would make the earth subject to man’s material\nneeds without ruining the earth (Gen. 1:28). At the beginning, the\nhomestead of man was a garden of fruit trees, not a hard field to\nbe plowed and planted. “Out of the ground the Lord God made\nto spring up every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for\nfood” (Gen. 2:9). Not only that, “a river flowed out of Eden to\nwater the garden” (v. 10).\nHappy Work before the Fall; Then Sweating and Fretting\nIn this all-supplying paradise God said, at first, “there was no man\nto work the ground” (v. 5). Then he made man from the ground,\nand, in his creation, Adam became a son working with his Father\nin the stewardship of creation. The essence of work was not sustenance of life. God gave himself as the sustainer. Man was free,\nnot from work, but in work, to be creative without the anxiety of\nproviding food and clothing.\nWhat changed with the entrance of sin into the world was\nnot that man had to work, but that work became hard with the\nfutility and frustration of the fallen creation. The Lord said to\nAdam:\nBecause you have listened to the voice of your wife and have\neaten of the tree of which I commanded you, “You shall not\neat of it,” cursed is the ground because of you; in pain you\nshall eat of it all the days of your life; thorns and thistles it\nshall bring forth for you; and you shall eat the plants of the\nfield. By the sweat of your face you shall eat bread, till you\nreturn to the ground. (Gen. 3:17–19)\n\nWhen man and woman chose to be self-reliant and rejected\nGod’s fatherly guidance and provision, God subjected them to the\nvery thing they chose: self-reliance. From now on, he says, if you\neat, it will be because you toil and sweat. So they were driven from\n\n\fMaking Much of Christ from 8 to 5 137\n\nthe garden of happy work to the ground of anxious toil. The curse\nunder which we live today is not that we must work. The curse\nis that, in our work, we struggle with weariness and frustration\nand calamities and anxiety. And all this is doubly burdensome\nbecause now by this very toil we must keep ourselves alive. “In\ntoil you shall eat of the ground. . . . In the sweat of your face you\nshall eat bread.”\nChrist Took the Curse on Himself,\nand We Are Being Freed\nBut hasn’t Christ come to lift the curse from his people? Yes.\n“Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a\ncurse for us—for it is written, ‘Cursed is everyone who is hanged\non a tree’” (Gal. 3:13). However, the curse is not lifted totally all\nat once. God saves us in stages. Christ delivered a mortal blow to\nevil when he died for sin and rose again. But not every enemy is\nyet put under his feet. For example, death is part of the curse we\nstill experience. Christ conquered death for his people, but only\npartly now. We still die, but the “sting” of death, the hopelessness\nof death, is removed because our sins are forgiven in Christ and\nhe is risen (1 Cor. 15:54–55)!\nSimilarly, we must still work hard to provide for our needs.\nChrist says, “Do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat\nor what you will drink, nor about your body, what you will put\non. . . . Your heavenly Father knows that you need them all. But\nseek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these\nthings will be added to you” (Matt. 6:25, 32–33). He says, “Come\nto me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest”\n(Matt. 11:28). He says, “Be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that in the Lord your labor\nis not in vain” (1 Cor. 15:58). In other words, God does not want\nhis children to be burdened with the frustration and futility and\ndepressing weariness of work. That much of the curse he aims to\nlift from us even in this age.\n\n[PAGE 138]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\nParadise Is Not Here Yet\nBut just as death will be a reality to the end of this age, so must\nwe work in this fallen age against many obstacles that often make\nwork hard. Not yet may we return to paradise and pick fruit in\nsomeone else’s garden. That’s the mistake they made at Thessalonica. Some were quitting their jobs and being idle because they\nthought that Christ would come very soon. Paradise was at hand.\nSo Paul wrote to them, “If anyone is not willing to work, let him\nnot eat. For we hear that some of you walk in idleness, not busy\nat work, but busybodies. Now such persons we command and\nencourage in the Lord Jesus Christ to do their work quietly and\nto earn their own living” (2 Thess. 3:10–12). Able-bodied people\nwho choose to live in idleness and eat the fruit of another’s sweat\nare in rebellion against God’s design. If we can, we should earn\nour own living.\nHow then do Christians make much of Christ in working “to\nearn their own living”? First, by conforming willingly to God’s\ndesign for this age. It is an act of obedience that honors his authority. Second, by removing stumbling blocks from unbelievers\nwho would regard the lazy dependence of Christians on others as\nan evidence that our God is not worthy of following. “Work with\nyour hands . . . so that you may live properly before outsiders and\nbe dependent on no one” (1 Thess. 4:11–12). We honor God by\nearning our living because this clears the way for non-Christians\nto see Christ for who he really is. Aimless, unproductive Christians\ncontradict the creative, purposeful, powerful, merciful God we\nlove. They waste their lives.\nDo Not Labor for the Food That Perishes\nThird, we make much of God by earning our own living when\nwe focus not on financial profit but on the benefit our product or\nservice brings to society. This is paradoxical. I am saying, yes, we\nshould earn enough money to meet our needs. But, no, we should\nnot make that the primary focus of why we work. One of the most\n\n\fMaking Much of Christ from 8 to 5 139\n\nstriking things Jesus ever said was, “Do not work for the food\nthat perishes, but for the food that endures to eternal life, which\nthe Son of Man will give to you” (John 6:27). Do not labor for\nthe food that perishes! “The food that perishes” simply means all\nordinary food and provision. So this is striking! It seems to say the\nexact opposite of what I am saying. What does he mean?\nWe know from all we have seen so far that Jesus does not\nmean it is wrong to earn your own living and eat your own bread.\nEvidently then, he means that when we work for the food that\nperishes, there should be a significant sense in which we are not\nworking for that food, but for something more. In other words,\ndon’t focus on mere material things in your work. Don’t labor\nmerely with a view to the perishable things you can buy with your\nearnings. Work with an eye not mainly to your money, but your\nusefulness. Work with a view to benefiting people with what you\nmake or do.\nChrist has lifted the curse of work. He has replaced anxious\ntoil with trust in God’s promise to supply our needs (Phil. 4:19)\nand has thus awakened in us a different passion in our work. We\nturn with joy to the call of Jesus: Seek the kingdom of God first\nand his righteousness, and the food that perishes will be added to\nyou. So don’t labor for the food that perishes. Labor to love people\nand honor God. Think of new ways that your work can bless\npeople. Stop thinking mainly of profitability, and think mainly of\nhow helpful your product or service can become.\nDo Your Business Dealings but Stay Free from Them\nHow do you get up in the morning and go to work not for the food\nthat perishes—not mainly for the profit? This is really a spiritual\ndiscovery, attained through much prayer and longing. My words of\nexplanation won’t make it happen. But maybe the Holy Spirit will\nuse these words to advance your quest. Paul said in 1 Corinthians\n7:30–31 that since we live in a time of great urgency, “those who\nbuy [should buy] as though they had no goods, and those who deal\n\n[PAGE 140]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\nwith the world as though they had no dealings with it.” I think this\nis another way of saying, yes, labor, but do not labor for the food\nthat perishes. Go ahead and purchase, but act as though you have\nno goods. Do your business dealings, but stay free from them. The\nfinancial outcome of these dealings is not your life.\nSay You Are a Stockbroker\nSuppose you are a Christian stockbroker and have watched the\nmarket tumble. What it means to you not to labor for the food\nthat perishes is that your true life is not jeopardized. Your peace\nand joy are not destroyed. Your resolve to do the best you can\nfor your clients remains the same—even if you advise them to get\nout of the market and use their money a different way for God’s\nglory. You are not working for the food that perishes. Your goal\nis to enjoy Christ’s being exalted in the way you work. Jesus said,\n“I have food to eat that you do not know about. . . . My food is\nto do the will of him who sent me and to accomplish his work”\n(John 4:32–34). None of us in our vocations should aim mainly\nat the food that perishes—leave that to the Lord. We should aim\ninstead to do the will of him who sent us. And his will is that we\ntreasure him above all else and live like it.\nThe Christian stockbroker will say in the face of a falling market,\n“The main food I want from this job is still there. I am hungry above\nall to pass this test of faith and have a deep restfulness in the goodness\nand power of Christ. I am hungry to enjoy his name being esteemed\nas others see my demeanor and my integrity and give Christ glory.”\nAnd to that end he labors for the food that endures to eternal life. He\nlabors, rising early for prayer and meditation and holding Christ near\nto his heart all day. In that security he thinks of the good of others\nand serves them. That is a wonder, not a wasted life.\nJesus calls us to be aliens and exiles in the world. Not by taking us\nout of the world, but by changing, at the root, how we view the world\nand how we do our work in it. If we simply work to earn a living—\nif we labor for the bread that perishes—we will waste our lives. But\n\n\fMaking Much of Christ from 8 to 5 141\n\nif we labor with the sweet assurance that God will supply all our\nneeds—that Christ died to purchase every undeserved blessing—then\nall our labor will be a labor of love and a boasting only in the cross.\n5. We make much of Christ in our secular work by earning money\nwith the desire to use our money to make others glad in God.\nEverything I said in chapter 7 assumed that we had money to use in\na radical way to show that Christ and not money is our Treasure.\nBut money does not grow on trees; we work for it. We provide\nsome service or make some product that others will pay for. So my\npoint here is that, as we work, we should dream of how to use our\nexcess money to make others glad in God. Of course, we should\nuse all our money to make others glad in God, in the sense that our\nwhole life has this aim. But the point here is that our secular work\ncan become a great God-exalting blessing to the world if we aim to\ntake the earnings we don’t need for ourselves (and we need far less\nthan we think) and meet the needs of others in the name of Jesus.\nThe Able-Bodied Earners Help the Victims of Loss\nGod clearly tells us that we should work to provide the needs of those\nwho can’t meet their own needs. It’s true that everyone should work\nif he can, and that, in general, if you work you will have what you\nneed. “Whoever works his land will have plenty of bread” (Prov.\n12:11). But this general rule is not absolute. Drought may strike your\nfarm; thieves may steal what you’ve earned; disability may end your\nearning power. All that is part of the curse that sin brought into the\nworld. But God, in his mercy, wills that the work of the able-bodied\nsupply the needs of the helpless, especially in hard times.\nThree passages of Scripture make this plain. In 1 Timothy 5:8\nPaul speaks to children and grandchildren regarding the aged widows: “If anyone does not provide for his relatives, and especially\nfor members of his own household, he has denied the faith and is\nworse than an unbeliever.” In Acts 20:35 Paul refers to his own\nmanual labor and then says, “In all things I have shown you that\n\n[PAGE 142]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\nby working hard in this way we must help the weak and remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he himself said, ‘It is more\nblessed to give than to receive.’” Then in Ephesians 4:28 Paul\ndoesn’t settle for saying, “Don’t steal, work!” He says, “Let the\nthief no longer steal, but rather let him labor, doing honest work\nwith his own hands, so that he may have something to share with\nanyone in need.” You can steal to have. Or you can work to have.\nOr you can work to have to give. When the third option comes\nfrom joy in God’s goodness, it makes him look great in the world.\n6. We make much of Christ in our secular work by treating the\nweb of relationships it creates as a gift of God to be loved by sharing the gospel and by practical deeds of help.\nI put this last not because it is least important but because some who\nput it first never say anything else about the importance of secular\nwork. I have made this mistake myself. Personal evangelism is so\nimportant that it is easy to think of it as the only important thing\nin life. But we have seen that the Bible puts a lot of emphasis on\nadorning the gospel, not merely saying the gospel. But now I want\nto say that speaking the good news of Christ is part of why God put\nyou in your job. He has woven you into the fabric of others’ lives\nso that you will tell them the gospel. Without this, all our adorning\nbehavior may lack the one thing that could make it life-giving.\nThe Christian’s calling includes making his or her mouth a\nfountain of life. “The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life”\n(Prov. 10:11). The link with eternal life is faith in Jesus Christ.\nNo nice feelings about you as a good employee will save anyone.\nPeople must know the gospel, which is the power of God unto\neternal life (Rom. 1:16). “Faith comes from hearing, and hearing\nthrough the word of Christ” (Rom. 10:17).\nThe early church was a “gospelling” band of people. They\nspoke the gospel. When the believers were driven out of Jerusalem\nbecause of persecution after Stephen’s martyrdom, they “went\nabout preaching the word”—literally, “evangelizing or gospelling",

Their self-identity was “proclaimers”: “You are a\nchosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his\nown possession, that you may proclaim the excellencies of him\nwho called you out of darkness into his marvelous light” (1 Pet.\n2:9). Freely they had received. Freely they gave.\nThey were moved by the words of Jesus concerning the value of\na single human life: “What does it profit a man to gain the whole\nworld and forfeit his life? For what can a man give in return for his\nlife?” (Mark 8:36–37). They felt the weight of what C. S. Lewis spoke\ntwenty centuries later when he pondered the relationship between\nwinning one soul to Christ, on the one hand, and the value of his own\nvocation as an Oxford scholar of English Literature on the other hand:\nThe Christian will take literature a little less seriously than the\ncultured Pagan. . . . The unbeliever is always apt to make a\nkind of religion of his aesthetic experiences . . . and he commonly wishes to maintain his superiority to the great mass\nof mankind who turn to books for mere recreation. But the\nChristian knows from the outset that the salvation of a single\nsoul is more important than the production or preservation of\nall the epics and tragedies in the world: and as for superiority,\nhe knows that the vulgar since they include most of the poor\nprobably include most of the superiors.4\n\nThe point is not that Lewis quit his work and became a fulltime evangelist, nor that you should. The point is that he saw the\nmeaning of his work in proper perspective and knew that more\nthan one thing gave it significance. To each of the five ways that\nwe have mentioned above, Lewis would add that his vocation\ncreated a web of relationships in which he could speak the gospel.\nOnce when he was criticized for oversimplifying the gospel, he\nresponded to his critic:\n4. C. S. Lewis, “Christianity and Literature,” in Christian Reflections (Grand Rapids,\nMI: Eerdmans, 1967), 10.\n\n[PAGE 144]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\n[He] would be a more helpful critic if he advised a cure as\nwell as asserting many diseases. How does he himself do such\nwork? What methods, and with what success, does he employ\nwhen he is trying to convert the great mass of storekeepers,\nlawyers, realtors, morticians, policemen and artisans who surround him in his own city?5\n\nPerhaps one other thing should be mentioned in regard to the\nrelationships created by where we live and work. For many of you,\nthe move toward missions and deeds of mercy will not be a move\naway from your work but with your work to another, more needy,\nless-reached part of the world. Christians should seriously ask not\nonly what their vocation is, but where it should be lived out. We\nshould not assume that teachers and carpenters and computer programmers and managers and CPAs and doctors and pilots should\ndo their work in America. That very vocation may be better used in\na country that is otherwise hard to get into, or in a place where poverty makes access to the gospel difficult. In this way the web of relationships created by our work is not only strategic but intentional.\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, secular work is not a waste when we make much of\nChrist from 8 to 5. God’s will in this age is that his people be scattered like salt and light in all legitimate vocations. His aim is to be\nknown, because knowing him is life and joy. He does not call us out\nof the world. He does not remove the need to work. He does not\ndestroy society and culture. Through his scattered saints he spreads\na passion for his supremacy in all things for the joy of all peoples. If\nyou work like the world, you will waste your life, no matter how rich\nyou get. But if your work creates a web of redemptive relationships\nand becomes an adornment for the gospel of the glory of Christ, your\nsatisfaction will last forever and God will be exalted in your joy.\n5.

He is like the “Hound of\nHeaven” who means to make you far happier in some dangerous\nand dirty work. Missionaries and ministers of mercy don’t come\nfrom nowhere. They come from people like you, stunned by the\nglory of God and stopped in your tracks. Sometimes it happens\nwhen you are going in exactly the opposite direction.\n\nHow God Caught Adoniram Judson for Burma\nThat’s the way it was with Adoniram Judson, the first overseas\nmissionary from America, who sailed with his wife at age twentythree on February 17, 1812. They had been married twelve days.\nHe spent the rest of his life, until 1850, “suffering yet always\nrejoicing” to bring Burma under the sway of Christ and make the\npeople glad in God forever. But first God had to turn him around,\nand he did it in a way that so stunned Judson, he never forgot the\nprovidence of God in his conversion.1\n1. For more on Adoniram Judson, see John Piper, Filling Up the Afflictions of Christ:\nThe Cost of Bringing the Gospel to the Nations in the Lives of William Tyndale, Adoniram\nJudson, and John Paton, The Swans Are Not Silent (Wheaton, IL: Crossway, 2009).\n\n[PAGE 146]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\nThe son of a pastor, he was a brilliant boy. His mother taught\nhim to read in one week when he was three to surprise his father\nwhen he came home from a trip.2 When he was sixteen he entered\nRhode Island College (later Brown University) as a sophomore\nand graduated at the top of his class three years later in 1807.\n\nThe Detour from God\nWhat his godly parents did not know was that Adoniram was\nbeing lured away from the faith by a fellow student named Jacob\nEames, who was a Deist.3 By the time Judson’s college career was\nfinished, he had no Christian faith. He kept this concealed from\nhis parents until his twentieth birthday, August 9, 1808, when he\nbroke their hearts with his announcement that he had no faith and\nthat he wanted to write for the theater and intended to go to New\nYork, which he did six days later on a horse his father gave him\nas part of his inheritance.\nIt did not prove to be the life of his dreams. He attached himself to some strolling players and, as he said later, lived “a reckless,\nvagabond life, finding lodgings where he could, and bilking the\nlandlord where he found opportunity.”4 The disgust with what he\nfound there was the beginning of several remarkable providences.\nGod was closing in on Adoniram Judson.\nHe went to visit his Uncle Ephraim in Sheffield but found there\ninstead “a pious young man” who amazed him by being firm in\nhis Christian convictions without being “austere and dictatorial.”5\nStrange that he should find this young man there instead of the\nuncle he sought.\n2. Courtney Anderson, To the Golden Shore: The Life of Adoniram Judson (Grand\nRapids, MI: Zondervan, 1956), 14.\n3. Deism was “the belief, based solely on reason, in a God who created the universe\nand then abandoned it, assuming no control over life, exerting no influence on natural phenomena, and giving no supernatural revelation,” The American Heritage Dictionary of the\nEnglish Language, 4th ed. (Boston: Houghton Miflin, 2000).\n4. Anderson, To the Golden Shore, 41.\n5. Ibid., 42.\n\n\fThe Majesty of Christ in Missions and Mercy: A Plea to This Generation 147\n\nThe Unforgettable Night\nThe next night he stayed in a small village inn where he had never\nbeen before. The innkeeper apologized that his sleep might be interrupted because there was a man critically ill in the next room.\nThrough the night Judson heard comings and goings and low\nvoices and groans and gasps. It bothered him to think that the\nman next to him may not be prepared to die. He wondered about\nhimself and had terrible thoughts of his own dying. He felt foolish because good Deists weren’t supposed to have these struggles.\nWhen he was leaving in the morning he asked if the man next\ndoor was better. “He is dead,” said the innkeeper. Judson was\nstruck with the finality of it all. On his way out he asked, “Do\nyou know who he was?” “Oh yes. Young man from the college in\nProvidence. Name was Eames, Jacob Eames.”6\nJudson could hardly move. He stayed there for hours pondering death and eternity. If his friend Eames were right, then this\nwas a meaningless event. But Judson could not believe it: “That\nhell should open in that country inn and snatch Jacob Eames,\nhis dearest friend and guide, from the next bed—this could not,\nsimply could not, be pure coincidence.”7 God was real. And he\nwas pursuing Adoniram Judson. God knew the man he wanted to\nreach the Burmese people.\n\nAlive to Christ and Dead to America\nJudson’s conversion was not immediate. But now it was sure. God\nwas on his trail, like the apostle Paul on the Damascus road, and\nthere was no escape. There were months of struggle. He entered\nAndover Seminary in October 1808 and in December made solemn\ndedication of himself to God. On June 28, 1809, Judson presented\nhimself to the Congregationalists for missionary service in the East.\n6. Ibid., 44.

After knowing Ann\nHasseltine for one month he declared his intention to become a\nsuitor. He knew that the life he was about to embrace would not\nonly be dangerous and dirty, but also distant. He never expected\nto return to America. He did only once, thirty-three years later,\nthen never again. Ann went with him and died in Burma. Here is\nthe letter Judson wrote to her father asking for her partnership in\nmissions:\nI have now to ask, whether you can consent to part with your\ndaughter early next spring, to see her no more in this world;\nwhether you can consent to her departure, and her subjection\nto the hardships and sufferings of missionary life; whether you\ncan consent to her exposure to the dangers of the ocean, to the\nfatal influence of the southern climate of India; to every kind\nof want and distress; to degradation, insult, persecution, and\nperhaps a violent death. Can you consent to all this, for the\nsake of him who left his heavenly home, and died for her and\nfor you; for the sake of perishing, immortal souls; for the sake\nof Zion, and the glory of God? Can you consent to all this, in\nhope of soon meeting your daughter in the world of glory, with\nthe crown of righteousness, brightened with the acclamations\nof praise which shall redound to her Savior from heathens\nsaved, through her means, from eternal woe and despair?8\n\nHer father let her decide. She said yes.\nGod does not call us to ease, but to faithful joy. He is closing in\non some of you, smiling and with tears in his eyes, knowing how\nmuch of himself he is going to show you—and how much it will\ncost. As I write, I pray that you will not turn away.\n\nPity for People and a Passion for Christ Are One\nIf you have pity for perishing people and a passion for the reputation of Christ, you must care about world missions. One of the\n8. Ibid., 83.\n\n\fThe Majesty of Christ in Missions and Mercy: A Plea to This Generation 149\n\nburdens of this book is to show what life looks like when you believe that you dare not choose between the motives to love people\nand glorify Christ. They are not separate motives. Acting on one\nincludes acting on the other. Thus, if your aim is to love people,\nyou will lay down your life to make them eternally glad in God.\nAnd if your aim is to glorify Christ, who is God incarnate, you will\nalso lay down your life to make people eternally happy in God.\nThe reason for this is that any good-hearted goal, without the\ndesire to give people eternal joy in God, is condemnation with\na kind face. Love always wants what is best for the needy, and\nwhat’s best is enjoying God fully and forever. Similarly, any effort\nto honor Christ that does not aim to make him the all-satisfying\nTreasure of God’s treasonous subjects is complicity in the revolt.\nGod is only praised where he is prized. We pay our tribute to him\nwhen he is a Treasure to us. You cannot love man or honor God\nwithout doing both. This single passion—to see that Christ be glorified as perishing people become eternally satisfied in him—drives\nthe great global enterprise we call world missions.\n\nIf You Come With No Interest or Knowledge\nNot everybody comes to this chapter with a clear and driving\npassion for the glory of Christ among the unreached peoples of\nthe world. Most of us are pretty parochial and ethnocentric and\nnarrow, and even sometimes self-centered and racist, in our way\nof life. We hardly ever even think about the global, multinational,\nmultiethnic, multilinguistic cause of God, and what God’s passion and purposes are for Guinea and Indonesia and Tanzania\nand Thailand and Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan and Turkey and\nSlovakia and China and Siberia and Japan and Cameroon and\nMyanmar and the Somali or the Hmong or the Dakota or the\nOjibwa of Minnesota.\nSo I don’t assume that you come to this chapter with a clear\nand resounding interest in the really great news of the world—\nwhich the media never report—namely, the spread of Christian\n\nDont Waste Your Life.Redesign.555503.indd 149\n\n3/13/19 3:26 PM\n\n[PAGE 150]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\ntruth and faith among the peoples of the world on the way to a\nGod-wrought consummation that will make all of world history\nlook like what it really is—a brief prelude to the everlasting, allglorious kingdom of Christ. I don’t assume you come with your\nheart enthralled with God’s great global purpose. So I simply want\nto let God tell you, in his own words, about his priorities.\nAll the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to the Lord,\nand all the families of the nations shall worship before you.\nFor kingship belongs to the Lord, and he rules over the nations. (Ps. 22:27–28)\n\nThen there are Old Testament prayers:\nLet the peoples praise you, O God; let all the peoples praise\nyou! Let the nations be glad and sing for joy. (Ps. 67:3–4)\n\nThen there are Old Testament commands:\nDeclare his glory among the nations, his marvelous works\namong all the peoples! . . . Say among the nations, “The Lord\nreigns.” (Ps. 96:3, 10)\n\nThen there is the great New Testament Commission from the risen\nChrist:\nJesus came and said to them, “All authority in heaven and on\nearth has been given to me. Go therefore and make disciples of\nall nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the\nSon and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I\nhave commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to\nthe end of the age.” (Matt. 28:18–20)\n\nThen there is the apostle Paul’s great life of utter dedication to\nthis mission:\nI make it my ambition to preach the gospel, not where Christ\nhas already been named, lest I build on someone else’s foundation, but as it is written, “Those who have never been told\n\n\fThe Majesty of Christ in Missions and Mercy: A Plea to This Generation 151\n\nof him will see, and those who have never heard will understand.” (Rom. 15:20–21)\n\nThen there is the magnificent picture of the final outcome of God’s\npurposes in history:\nAnd they sang a new song, saying, “Worthy are you [O Christ]\nto take the scroll and to open its seals, for you were slain, and\nby your blood you ransomed people for God from every tribe\nand language and people and nation, and you have made them\na kingdom and priests to our God, and they shall reign on the\nearth.” (Rev. 5:9–10)\n\nA Summary Statement of Faith on Missions\nFrom these and many other Scriptures, I have been impelled over\nthe years to think and preach and write about Christ’s great global\npurpose called missions. Several years ago the elders of our church\ndrafted a statement of faith to guide us in the education of our apprentices and in the selection of new elders. Paragraph 13 of that\ndocument summarizes our sense of what missions is:\nWe believe that the commission given by the Lord Jesus to make\ndisciples of all nations is binding on His Church to the end of\nthe age. This task is to proclaim the Gospel to every tribe and\ntongue and people and nation, baptizing them, teaching them the\nwords and ways of the Lord, and gathering them into churches\nable to fulfill their Christian calling among their own people. The\nultimate aim of world missions is that God would create, by His\nWord, worshippers who glorify His name through glad-hearted\nfaith and obedience. Missions exists because worship doesn’t.\nWhen this age is over, and the countless millions of the redeemed\nfall on their faces before the throne of God, missions will be no\nmore. It is a temporary necessity. But worship abides forever.\nWorship, therefore, is the fuel and the goal of missions.9\n9.

Christ came and died and rose again in\norder to gather a joyful, countless company for his name from\nall the peoples of the world. This is what every Christian should\ndream about. I say this carefully, in view of what I wrote in\nchapter 8 about secular vocations. It is crucial that millions of\nChristians fulfill their life calling in secular jobs, just as it is crucial that during wartime the entire fabric of life and culture not\nunravel. But during wartime, even the millions of civilians love to\nget news from the front lines. They love to hear of the triumphs\nof the troops. They dream about the day when war will be no\nmore. So it is with Christians. All of us should dream about this.\nWe should love to hear how the advance of King Jesus is faring. We should love to hear of gospel triumphs as Christ plants\nhis church among peoples held for centuries by alien powers of\ndarkness.\nThis is God’s design in world history—that people from all\nnations and tribes and languages come to worship and treasure\nChrist above all things. Or as Paul put it in Romans 15:9, “that\nthe Gentiles [all the peoples] might glorify God for his mercy.”\nThere can be no weary resignation, no cowardly retreat, and no\nmerciless contentment among Christ’s people while he is disowned\namong thousands of unreached peoples. Every Christian (who\nloves people and honors Christ) must care about this.\n\nThe Inadequacy of the Batboy’s Perspective\nSomeone might say, “But isn’t the gospel about finding forgiveness\nof my sins and getting the hope of eternal life and being filled with\nthe Spirit of holiness and being changed into the image of Jesus\nso that I am a better mom or dad or son or daughter or friend or\nemployer or citizen?” The answer, of course, is yes. But if that is\nall we focus on in our walk with God, we miss the big picture.\nWe miss the bigger point of it all. We are like batboys at Yankee\n\n\fThe Majesty of Christ in Missions and Mercy: A Plea to This Generation 153\n\nStadium who think the great point of the World Series is to hand\nthe players a bat.\nSo I urge you in the name of Jesus to wake up, and enlarge\nyour heart, and stretch your mind, and spread your wings. Mount\nup above your limited life—yes, a very important life, which God\ndoes not diminish—and see the great and thrilling big picture of\nGod’s global purposes for the history of the world that cannot fail.\n“My counsel shall stand,” says the Lord, “and I will accomplish\nall my purpose” (Isa. 46:10). “At the name of Jesus every knee\n[will] bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every\ntongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the\nFather” (Phil. 2:10–11). “This gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the whole world as a testimony to all nations,\nand then the end will come” (Matt. 24:14).\n\nDon’t Take Offense—Join the Joyful Partnership\nAnd as God gives you wings to rise up and see the world the way\nhe sees it, many of you, I pray, will be loosened from your present\nsituation—job, neighborhood, state, nation, plan—and be called\nto a direct engagement in this great historic, global purpose of\nGod as a goer and not only a sender. Let no one who is devoted\nto local ministry or to crucial secular engagement take offense at\nthis plea. Rather rejoice. You are free to stay or free to go. Many\nof you must stay. Your staying is crucial for God’s purposes where\nyou are, and it is crucial for his purposes where you are not, but\nwhere others may go. There is no need for guilt or resentment.\nThere is great need for joyful partnership.\nThose of you who stay—the senders—should keep this remarkable fact in mind: Foreign missions is a validation of all ministries\nof mercy at home because it exports them abroad. Planting the\nchurch in an unreached people means planting the base of operations for all the mercy Jesus commanded for the poor. If we don’t\nlet our light shine before the people at home “so that they may see\n[our] good works and give glory to [our] Father who is in heaven”\n\n[PAGE 154]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\n(Matt. 5:16), what kind of obedience will we export to the nations? The Great Commission includes the words, “teaching them\nto observe all that I [Jesus] have commanded you” (Matt. 28:20).\nAnd what did he command? He told the story of the desperate\nwounded man and the good Samaritan who “showed him mercy,”\nand then said to all of us, “You go, and do likewise” (Luke 10:37).\n\nMercy at Home Makes Missions Credible\nThe people who stay in the homeland are surrounded by need. We\nonly need eyes to see and hearts that can’t walk by on the other\nside. This challenge is not separate from the challenge of missions.\nShowing practical mercy to the poor displays the beauty of Christ\nat home and makes the exportation of the Christian faith credible.\nWe are hypocrites to pretend enthusiasm for overseas ministry\nwhile neglecting the miseries at home. There was something wrong\nwith the priest and the Levite in the story of the good Samaritan,\nwho had their distant religious aims but were not moved by suffering close at hand where they would have to get their own hands\ndirty. Ministries of mercy close at hand validate the authenticity\nof our distant concerns.\nForeign missions and hometown mercy are linked in the very\nnature of the gospel that we are to send to the nations. The heart\nof the gospel is this: “Though [Christ] was rich, yet for your sake\nhe became poor, so that you by his poverty might become rich”\n(2 Cor. 8:9). The salvation we savor for ourselves and send to others is a ministry of God’s mercy to the poor, which includes all of\nus. We owe our lives to God’s commitment to missions and mercy.\nHe came a long way to help us, and his help includes every kind of\nhelp we need. And he got dirty doing it. In fact he got killed. This\nmerciful suffering is the purchase and the path of our salvation.\n“Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, so that you\nmight follow in his steps” (1 Pet. 2:21). Missions and mercy are\ninextricable because the very gospel we take to the nations models\nand mandates mercy to the poor at home.\n\n\fThe Majesty of Christ in Missions and Mercy: A Plea to This Generation 155\n\nM’Cheyne’s Devastating Comparison\nI have never read a better statement of this connection than the following quote from Robert Murray M’Cheyne, a young pastor in\nScotland who died at age twenty-nine in 1843. He answers some\nof the niggling questions about ministry to the poor by comparing\nit to Christ’s ministry to us.\nNow dear Christians, some of you pray night and day to be\nbranches of the true Vine; you pray to be made all over in\nthe image of Christ. If so, you must be like him in giving . . .\n“though he was rich, yet for our sakes he became poor” . . .\nObjection 1. “My money is my own.” Answer: Christ\nmight have said, “My blood is my own, my life is my own”\n. . . then where should we have been?\nObjection 2. “The poor are undeserving.” Answer: Christ\nmight have said, “They are wicked rebels . . . shall I lay down\nmy life for these? I will give to the good angels.” But no, he\nleft the ninety-nine, and came after the lost. He gave his blood\nfor the undeserving.\nObjection 3. “The poor may abuse it.” Answer: Christ\nmight have said the same; yea, with far greater truth. Christ\nknew that thousands would trample his blood under their feet;\nthat most would despise it; that many would make it an excuse\nfor sinning more; yet he gave his own blood.\nOh, my dear Christians! If you would be like Christ, give\nmuch, give often, give freely, to the vile and poor, the thankless and the undeserving. Christ is glorious and happy and so\nwill you be. It is not your money I want, but your happiness.\nRemember his own word, “It is more blessed to give than to\nreceive.”10\n\nJust as there is a partnership between the gospel itself and\nmercy to the nearby poor, so there is a wonderful partnership\n10. Robert Murray M’Cheyne, Sermon LXXXII in The Works of the Late Rev. Robert\nMurray M’Cheyne, 4 vols. (New York: Robert Carter, 1847), 2:479. I found this reading\nTimothy J. Keller, Ministries of Mercy: The Call of the Jericho Road (Phillipsburg, NJ: P&R,\n1997), 65. I wish every one of my readers would read Keller’s book.\n\n[PAGE 156]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\nbetween Christians being the merciful church at home and Christians planting the merciful church abroad. Neither is a wasted\nlife. Indeed the authenticity of each depends much on the authenticity of the other. It is inauthentic to presume to send what\nwe don’t have. And it is inauthentic to have a treasure and not\nsend it.\n\nThe Roots of the Student Volunteer Movement\nThe joyful partnership between ministering laypeople at home\nand missionaries abroad has happened before, and it can happen\nagain. In the first decades of the twentieth century, the Student\nVolunteer Movement exploded on the American scene with immense missionary impact. It was remarkable for the number of\nmissionaries sent and for the depth and breadth of the laymen who\nsupported it. It was a magnificent partnership.\nThe roots of the Student Volunteer Movement (SVM) went\nback as far as the famous Haystack Prayer Meeting in 1806 in\nMassachusetts. A spiritual awakening stirred the students of Williams College and prompted a small band of young men to devote\nthemselves to prayer twice a week by the Hoosack River. They\nfocused on the spiritual welfare of the other students. In August\n1806, they were caught in a thunderstorm on their way home and\ntook refuge under the edges of a chewed-out haystack. They used\nthe time to continue praying. This time they pleaded for the awakening of foreign missionary interest among the students.\nOne of them, Samuel Mills, urged the little group to consider\ntheir own willingness to be missionaries. To feel the weight of\nthis moment, we have to remember that at this time in American history not one foreign missionary had left the shores of\nAmerica. There were no missionary societies. Churches, by and\nlarge, had no vision for the unreached peoples across the dangerous oceans. There was, as many say today, plenty to do at home.\nWhich was true! But this little band of praying students could\nno longer be content with an American church whose heart did\n\n\fThe Majesty of Christ in Missions and Mercy: A Plea to This Generation 157\n\nnot burn with love for unreached peoples and with zeal for the\nglory of God among the nations. They could no longer be satisfied with a church that sent no foreign missionaries. Against all\nthis spiritual, historical, and structural inertia, God enabled them\nto break through.\n\n“The Brethren” Were Born\nPraying under the haystack they dedicated themselves to missionary service. “It was from this haystack meeting that the foreign\nmissionary movement of the churches of the United States had an\ninitial impulse.”11 In September of 1808, the group formed the\n“Society of the Brethren” to strengthen their resolve to give themselves to missionary service. Samuel Mills spread “The Brethren”\nvision as he studied at Yale and then at Andover Seminary. He had\ntransferred to Andover to be a part of what God was doing there\nunder the student leadership of Adoniram Judson. This group of\n“Brethren” at Andover gave the impetus to the first American\nmission agency (the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions); and from this group were sent the first overseas\nAmerican missionaries in 1812.\n\nThe Student Volunteer Movement Is Born\nIn 1846, Royal Wilder went to India under this first American\nBoard of Commissioners. He returned in 1877 for health reasons and settled in Princeton. There his son, Robert, formed the\n“Princeton Foreign Missionary Society.” The prayers of this group\ngave rise to a crucial gathering called by D. L. Moody at Mount\nHermon, Massachusetts, in the summer of 1886. Two hundred\nand fifty-one students gathered for a month-long Bible conference. After a compelling address by pastor A. T. Pierson on behalf\nof world missions, a hundred of these students volunteered for\noverseas service. The spirit of this event gripped the student world.\n11. Kenneth Scott Latourette, These Sought a Country (New York: Harper and Brothers, 1950), 46.\n\n[PAGE 158]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\nDuring the school year 1886–1887, Robert Wilder and John Forman traveled to 167 campuses to spread the vision. The formal\norganization of the Student Volunteer Movement happened two\nyears later with John R. Mott as its chairman.\nThe purpose, as Mott expressed it, had five parts:\nThe fivefold purpose of the Student Volunteer Movement is\nto lead students to a thorough consideration of the claims of\nforeign missions upon them personally as a lifework; to foster\nthis purpose by guiding students who become volunteers in\ntheir study and activity for missions until they come under\nthe immediate direction of the Mission Boards; to unite all\nvolunteers in a common, organized, aggressive movement; to\nsecure a sufficient number of well-qualified volunteers to meet\nthe demands of the various Mission Boards; and to create\nand maintain an intelligent, sympathetic and active interest in\nforeign missions on the part of students who are to remain at\nhome in order to ensure the strong backing of the missionary\nenterprise by their advocacy, their gifts and their prayers.12\n\n“The growth of the SVM in the following three decades was\nnothing short of phenomenal.”13 The rallying cry was, “Evangelization of the world in this generation.” By 1891 there were 6,200\nstudent volunteers who had signed a statement that read, “It is\nmy purpose, if God permit, to become a foreign missionary.” Of\nthese, 321 had already sailed for overseas service. The peak year\nof the SVM was 1920, when 2,738 students signed the pledge card\nand 6,890 attended the quadrennial convention. “By 1945, at the\nmost conservative estimate, 20,500 students . . . who had signed\nthe declaration, reached the field.”14\n12.

For example, the Student Volunteer Movement ignited not\njust students but the laymen of the churches. J. Campbell White,\nthe first secretary of the Layman’s Missionary Movement, wrote in\n1909, “During the last twenty years the missionary spirit has had\na marvelous development among the colleges of the United States\nand Canada . . . leading thousands of strong men and women to\nlive with a dominating missionary life purpose.”15 Attracted by\nthis zeal, a young businessman attended the 1906 SVM convention in Nashville. He thought to himself, If the laymen of North\nAmerica could see the world as these students are seeing it, they\nwould rise up in their strength and provide all the funds needed for\nthe enterprise.16 At a prayer meeting of businessmen on November\n15, 1906, in New York, the Layman’s Missionary Movement was\nborn.\nIts stated aim was “investigation, agitation and organization;\nthe investigation by laymen of missionary conditions, the agitation\nof laymen of an adequate missionary policy, and the organization\nof laymen to co-operate with the ministers and Missionary Boards\nin enlisting the whole Church in its supreme work of saving the\nworld.”17\n\nThe Gift of Passionate Leaders\nJust as God had prepared extraordinary leadership for the SVM\nin Robert Wilder, Robert Speer, and John R. Mott, so he raised\nup leaders for the Layman’s Missionary Movement who spoke\nwith such prophetic power that thousands of laymen caught the\nvision for God’s global purposes. The leader of the movement\n15. J. Campbell White, “The Layman’s Missionary Movement,” in Perspectives on the\nWorld Christian Movement: A Reader, ed. Ralph D. Winter and Steven C.

He was a businessman.\nThe partnership that emerged between students, who were going,\nand businessmen, who were sending, was profound, because there\nwere God-centered visionary leaders in both groups. Both were\nmoved by the same passion not to waste their lives. You can hear\nit in almost every sentence that J. Campbell White wrote:\nMost men are not satisfied with the permanent output of\ntheir lives. Nothing can wholly satisfy the life of Christ\nwithin his followers except the adoption of Christ’s purpose\ntoward the world he came to redeem. Fame, pleasure and\nriches are but husks and ashes in contrast with the boundless\nand abiding joy of working with God for the fulfillment of\nhis eternal plans. The men who are putting everything into\nChrist’s undertaking are getting out of life its sweetest and\nmost priceless rewards.18\n\nSenders Are Unashamed to Embrace the Cause of Going\nAgain, this is not a contradiction of what I wrote about the value\nof secular work in chapter 8. The point is that, in a war, no matter\nhow valuable the civilian work is in itself, everyone longs for his\nlife to count also for the distant war effort, where enemy lines are\nbeing breached. Laypeople, pastors, churches—all of us who stay\nbehind—will find the “sweetest and most priceless rewards” as we\nenlarge our hearts to embrace not only the needs close to home,\nbut also the hard and unreached places of the world.\nThese businessmen from a hundred years ago saw their secular\ncalling and their missionary vision as an integrated whole. The\nway J. Campbell White articulated the vision of the movement\ngave the businessmen categories for understanding the unity of\nlife under the lordship of Christ. He said:\nThis movement makes the largest possible demands upon men.\nIt strives simply to voice to them God’s call for a life whose\n18. Ibid., 225.\n\n\fThe Majesty of Christ in Missions and Mercy: A Plea to This Generation 161\n\ndominant purpose is to establish the reign of Christ in human\nrelationships. . . . It reminds them . . . that selfishness is suicidal while service of others brings to the soul the supremest\npossible satisfaction.19\n\nThe Startling Effect on the Church Then,\nbut What about Today?\nWhite showed his generation that a passion for missions was not\nonly the way to save the world, but also to save the church:\nThe effort to evangelize the world presents the speediest and\nsurest methods of saving the Church. Our material resources\nare so stupendous that we are in danger of coming to trust in\nriches rather than in God. “If a man is growing large in wealth,\nnothing but constant giving can keep him from growing small\nin soul.” The evangelization of the world is the only enterprise\nlarge enough and important enough to provide an adequate\noutlet for the Church’s wealth.20\n\nThis is still true. Missions is not only crucial for the life of the\nworld. It is crucial for the life of the church. We will perish with\nour wealth if we do not pour ourselves out in ministries of mercy\nat home and missions among the unreached peoples. We are very\nwealthy in America. All the money needed to send and support\nan army of self-sacrificing, joy-spreading ambassadors is already\nin the church. But we are not giving it.\nIn 1916, Protestants were giving 2.9% of their incomes to\ntheir churches. In 1933, the depth of the Great Depression,\nit was 3.2%. In 1955, just after affluence began spreading\nthrough our culture, it was still 3.2%. By 2000, when Americans were over 450% richer, after taxes and inflation, than in\nthe Great Depression, Protestants were giving 2.6% of their\nincomes to their churches.21\n19. Ibid., 224.\n20. Ibid., 225.\n21. See http://www.emptytomb.org/fig1_07.html.\n\n[PAGE 162]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\nMoreover, “If members of historically Christian churches in\nthe US has given at the 10% level in 2003, there would have been\nan additional $115 billion available.”22 Now add to that the really shocking fact that of the money given to the church, less than\n6 percent goes to foreign missions, and of that amount, about\n1 percent goes to fund breakthroughs to unreached peoples.23\nThis is not to say we should pull back on any front. The point is,\nthere is plenty for all the breakthroughs if we live to show that\nChrist is our Treasure.\n\nWe Will Not Know Him Fully outside His Mission\nFor its own soul the church needs to be involved in missions. We\nwill not know God in his full majesty until we know him moving\ntriumphantly among the nations. We will not admire and praise\nhim as we ought until we see him gathering a company of worshipers for himself from every people group on earth—including\nall the Muslim and Hindu and Buddhist peoples. Nothing enlarges our vision of God’s triumphant grace like the scope of his\nsaving work in history. What a story it is! “I will remember the\ndeeds of the Lord; yes, I will remember your wonders of old. I\nwill ponder all your work, and meditate on your mighty deeds”\n(Ps. 77:11–12). “Praise him for his mighty deeds; praise him according to his excellent greatness!” (Ps. 150:2). “Praise the Lord,\nall you Gentiles, and let all the peoples extol him” (Rom. 15:11,\nquoting Ps. 117:1).\n\nWhat Is Our Situation in the World Today?\nThe challenges of world evangelization are still very great. We are\nin a better position to know the scope and nature of the task than\never before. Patrick Johnstone writes, “For the first time in history we have a reasonably complete listing of the world’s peoples\n22. See http://www.emptytomb.org/scg03missions.pdf.\n23. See http://www.rockrohr.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/StatusOfGlobalMission\n-2010.pdf.\n\n\fThe Majesty of Christ in Missions and Mercy: A Plea to This Generation 163\n\nand the extent to which they have been evangelized.”24 There are\nvarious groups that do research to help the church know what\npeople groups around the world have been embraced by a Christian church or mission agency.25 Johnstone’s book gives a good\nsummary of the situation at the turn of our century.26\nOne way to describe the situation is to say that about 1.2–1.4\nbillion people have never had a chance to hear the gospel27—that\nis, they live in cultures where the preaching of the gospel in understandable ways is not accessible. Other analysts estimate the number of unevangelized somewhat higher. For example, the “Annual\nStatistical Table on Global Mission 2002” by David Barrett and\nTodd Johnson reports that there are 1,645,685,000 unevangelized\npeople in the world. That means 26.5 percent of the world’s population live in people groups that do not have indigenous evangelizing churches.28 About 95 percent of these live in what has been\ncalled the 10/40 window (between latitudes 10 and 40 degrees\nnorth of the equator and between the Atlantic and the Pacific\nOceans). This is the great challenge of our day.\nJohnstone puts it in hopeful historical perspective:\nStepping back we see a remarkable pattern emerging of the\n200 years growth [of the church] as it gathered momentum—\n1700s the North Atlantic, 1800s the Pacific, 1960s Africa,\n1970s Latin America, 1980s East Asia, 1990s Eurasia. This\none and a half times encirclement of the globe now leaves us\nwith the challenge of the 10/40 Window area. Central and\nSouth Asia and the Middle East are the remaining major areas\nof challenge. Where will the breakthroughs of the . . . first\ndecade of the . . . [new] millennium come? Will it be among\n24. Patrick Johnstone, The Church Is Bigger Than You Think (Ross-shire: Christian\nFocus, 1998), 229.\n25. See, for example, http://www.joshuaproject.net/.\n26. Johnstone, The Church Is Bigger Than You Think, 225–30.\n27. Ibid., 215. Johnstone is more optimistic than Barrett in his numbers: About 20 percent of the world’s population are unevangelized; 47 percent are non-Christians living where\nthey are likely to be evangelized; and 33 percent are professing Christians.\n28. David B. Barrett and Todd M. Johnson, “Annual Statistical Table on Global Mission\n2002,” International Bulletin of Missionary Research 26 (January 2002): 22–23.\n\n[PAGE 164]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\nMuslims, Hindus or Buddhists? These are the final unpenetrated bastions of the enemy’s hold on the souls of men. The\nrising tide of the gospel is lapping ever higher round this area,\nand we are even having foretastes of what that breakthrough\nmight mean. Would that I had the space and the freedom to tell\nof amazing things going on in these seemingly impenetrable\nideological fortresses.29\n\nGod Issues a Call to This Generation: Listen!\nThere is a call on this generation to obey the risen Christ and\nmake disciples of all the unreached peoples of the world. I am\npraying that God will raise up hundreds of thousands of young\npeople and “finishers” (people finishing one career and ready to\npursue a second in Christian ministry). I pray that this divine call\nwill rise in your heart with joy and not guilt. I pray that it will be\nconfirmed with the necessary gifts, and a compelling desire, and\nthe confirmation of your church, and the tokens of providence.\nFan into flame every flicker of desire by reading biographies, and\nmeditating on Scripture, and studying the unreached peoples, and\npraying for passion, and conversing with mission veterans. Don’t\nrun from the call. Pursue it.\nLet your mind dwell on the lostness of perishing individuals,\nbut also on whole people groups that do not have any access to\nthe gospel. This was Paul’s great ambition: “to preach the gospel,\nnot where Christ has already been named” (Rom. 15:20). There\nwill always be unconverted people to win where the church is already established. That is not the unique task of frontier missions.\nFrontier missions does what Paul aimed to do: Plant the church\nwhere there is now no possibility of ministry. This is the great need\nof the hour, not only for missionaries who go to serve the established church in other countries (which is a great need, especially\nin leadership development), but also for missionaries who go to\npeoples and places where there is no church to serve.\n29. Johnstone, The Church Is Bigger Than You Think, 115–16.\n\n\fThe Majesty of Christ in Missions and Mercy: A Plea to This Generation 165\n\nThe Day of Missions Is Not Over\nDon’t think the days of foreign missionaries are over, as if nationals can finish the work. There are hundreds of peoples and\nmillions of people where there are no Christian nationals to do\nsame-culture evangelism. A culture must be crossed. To be sure,\nit may be crossed by a non-Westerner, since God is growing his\nchurch faster in the non-Western world.30 That would be wonderful. I have no desire to limit the joy of love. Besides, it may be\nthat highly trained but tentative Western specialists will not be as\nfruitful as simpler, bold missionaries. Regarding missions to Muslims Patrick Johnstone says, “Often the best missionaries are the\nones who have studied little more than the basics of Islamics but\nhave a passion for sharing Christ. In their boldness for Jesus, they\nplunge into witnessing to Muslims, where an Islamist would fear\nto go.”31 But make no mistake. A culture will have to be crossed,\nand that’s what missions is. Missions, not same-culture evangelism\nby nationals, will finish the Great Commission.\nSo “pray earnestly to the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest” (Matt. 9:38), and ask him if you should\nbe one. Expect this prayer to change you. When Jesus told his\ndisciples to pray it, the next thing that happened was that he appointed twelve to be his apostles and sent them out. Pray for harvesters, and you may become one. God often wakens desire, and\ngives gifts, and opens doors when we are praying and pondering\nreal possibilities and real needs. Get a copy of the amazing world\nprayer guide called Operation World, and pray and read and\n30. This growth in the twentieth century is documented by Philip Jenkins, The New\nChristendom (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002), 2:\nOver the past century . . . the center of gravity in the Christian world has shifted\ninexorably southward to Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Already today the largest\nChristian communities on the planet are to be found in Africa and Latin America. If\nwe want to visualize a ‘typical’ contemporary Christian, we should think of a woman\nliving in a village in Nigeria or in a Brazilian favela. As Kenyan scholar John Mbiti has\nobserved, “the centers of the church’s universality [are] no longer in Geneva, Rome,\nAthens, Paris, London, New York, but in Kinshasa, Buenos Aires, Addis Ababa and\nManila. Whatever Europeans or North Americans may believe, Christianity is doing\nvery well indeed in the global South—not just surviving, but expanding.”\n31. Johnstone, The Church Is Bigger Than You Think, 273.\n\n[PAGE 166]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\nponder your way through the nations day by day.32 Think about\nthe people in places like\n• Libya with its six million people and perhaps ten indigenous believers.\n• Bhutan, a hermit Buddhist kingdom in the Himalayas,\ncut off from Christian witness for millennia with only a\nhandful of indigenous believers among its two and a half\nmillion people.\n• The Maldives, off the southwest coast of India, and one of\nthe most closed countries on earth.\n• North Korea, “a pariah nation gradually starving to death\nunder its crazed Communist leadership,”33 with no open\nwitness or church life for fifty years.\n• Saudi Arabia, the headquarters of Islam where Saudi believers, if found, are executed.\n• India, perhaps the greatest challenge of all, with its vast\nGanges plains that contain “the greatest concentration of\nunevangelized people in the world. For instance, the number of people in Uttar Pradesh in North India is about\n180,000,000 and the Christian percentage is 0.1% and\nfalling.”34\n• Turkey, the secular, mainly Muslim state with an ongoing\nChristian witness in only fifteen of its 100 provinces.\n\nPonder the Amnesty Offered to the\nNations. Take a Retreat\nThe point of that fragmentary list is to simply illustrate whole\npopulations living in rebellion against the true God and cut off\nfrom the only One who can reconcile them to their Maker. This\nmeans destruction for the unbelieving and dishonor to Christ. He\nowns this world, and the allegiance of every person is his right.\n32. Patrick Johnstone and Jason Mandryk, Operation World: When We Pray God Works\n(Waynesboro, GA: Paternoster USA, 2001). See the online version at http://www.operation\nworld.org.\n33. Ibid., 222.\n34. Ibid., 223.\n\n\fThe Majesty of Christ in Missions and Mercy: A Plea to This Generation 167\n\nEvery soul and every state is his. Abraham Kuyper put it memorably: “There is not a square inch in the whole domain of our human\nexistence over which Christ, who is Sovereign over all, does not\ncry: ‘Mine!’”35 Christ has come into this mutinous world, which\nhe made for his own glory, and paid for an amnesty with his own\nblood. Everyone who lays down the weaponry of unbelief will be\nabsolved from all crimes against the Sovereign of the universe. By\nfaith alone enemies will become happy subjects of an everlasting\nkingdom of justice and joy. Advancing this cause with Christ is\nworth your life.\nNo, you don’t have to be a missionary to admire and advance\nthe great purposes of God to be known and praised and enjoyed\namong all peoples. But if you want to be most fully satisfied with\nGod as he triumphs in the history of redemption, you can’t go on\nwith business as usual—doing your work, making your money,\ngiving your tithe, eating, sleeping, playing, and going to church.\nInstead you need to stop and go away for a few days with a Bible\nand notepad, and pray and think about how your particular time\nand place in life fits into the great purpose of God to make the\nnations glad in him. How will you join the great global purpose\nof God expressed in Psalm 67:4, “Let the nations be glad and sing\nfor joy”?\n\nThe Meaning of Your Discontent\nMany of you should stay where you are in your present job, and\nsimply ponder how you can fit your particular skills and relationships and resources more strategically into the global purpose of\nyour heavenly Father. But for others reading this book, it is going\nto be different. Many of you are simply not satisfied with what\nyou are doing. As J. Campbell White said, the output of your\nlives is not satisfying your deepest spiritual ambitions. We must\nbe careful here. Every job has its discouragements and its seasons\n35. Abraham Kuyper, “Sphere Sovereignty,” in Abraham Kuyper, A Centennial Reader,\ned. James D. Bratt (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1998), 488.\n\n[PAGE 168]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\nof darkness. We must not interpret such experiences automatically\nas a call to leave our post.\nBut if the discontent with your present situation is deep, recurrent, and lasting, and if that discontent grows in Bible-saturated\nsoil, God may be calling you to a new work. If, in your discontent,\nyou long to be holy, to walk pleasing to the Lord, and to magnify\nChrist with your one, brief life, then God may indeed be loosening your roots in order to transplant you to a place and a ministry\nwhere the deep spiritual ambitions of your soul can be satisfied.\nIt is true that God can be known and enjoyed in every legitimate\nvocation; but when he deploys you from one place to the next, he\noffers fresh and deeper drinking at the fountain of his fellowship.\nGod seldom calls us to an easier life, but always calls us to know\nmore of him and drink more deeply of his sustaining grace.\n\nShould I Go on Being a Pastor?\nI try to take stock of my own ministry in this way. Every year at\nour church we have a “Missions Week.” I preach on missions; we\nhave guest speakers. The challenge is given. People move toward\nmissions, make commitments, and join the pre-missions nurture\nprogram. And every year I reexamine my life as a pastor at this\nchurch. I look at what I am doing in the light of God’s global purpose, and in view of the incredible spiritual darkness and misery\nof the unreached peoples of this earth. I ask myself, Is this the\nmost strategic investment of my life for the sake of God’s purpose\nto make the nations glad in him? I ask my wife, “Noël, are you\nsensing any tugs to move closer to the front lines of the unreached\npeoples?”\nOur church mission statement puts the word “spread” in\nthe dominant position: “We exist to spread a passion for God’s\nsupremacy in all things for the joy of all peoples through Jesus\nChrist.” So I ask, Am I fulfilling this mission best in the role I now\nhave? When the Lord calls me to give an account of my ministry\nin the last day, will I be able to say, “Lord, I stayed at Bethlehem",

Big issues are in the offing. May\nGod help you. May God free you. May God give you a fresh,\nChrist-exalting vision for your life—whether you go to an unreached people or stay firmly and fruitfully at your present post.\nMay your vision get its meaning from God’s great purpose to\nmake the nations glad in him. May the cross of Christ be your only\nboast, and may you say, with sweet confidence, to live is Christ,\nand to die is gain.\n\n\f\f10\n\nMy Prayer—Let None Say in\nthe End, “I’ve Wasted It”\n\nYour steadfast love, oh Lord, is better than life. You have told us\nthis in many ways. With these very words you have said it through\nthe mouth of your servant David: “Because your steadfast love is\nbetter than life, my lips will praise you” (Ps. 63:3). You have said\nit in the words of your apostle Paul, when he cried out in prison,\n“My desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better”\n(Phil. 1:23). Oh Lord, how much better you are than life! Does\nyour apostle Paul not use strong language! Not just “better,” but\n“far better.” You are so much better than life that your apostle\nsays death is gain. “To live is Christ, and to die is gain” (v. 21).\nTo lose everything this world can offer and be left with you alone\nis gain.\nWhy, oh Lord, is your love better than life? Surely David gives\nus the answer in the way he speaks. He does not say, “Because\nyour steadfast love is better than life, my lips will praise your\nlove.” What does he say? He says that he will praise you, not\nyour love. “Because your steadfast love is better than life, my lips\nwill praise you.” Is this not because the most loving thing about\nyour love is that it brings us home to you—with eyes and hearts\n\n[PAGE 172]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\nand minds able to see the riches of your glory? With all your\nwrath removed, and all our sin forgiven, lest anything prevent the\npleasure of your presence. Is this not what divine love is—the will\nand work of God, to give us undeserving sinners everlasting joy in\nGod? What else could love be, if it would be infinite! What greater\nprize might we be given than yourself, if we are loved!\nOh, God, you know I tremble now for fear that many of the\nones who call you Lord have made themselves the prize and glory\nof your grace. How many, Lord, have made your love a witness\nto their worth! Is then their joy a resting in your worth or in their\nown? So many decades have gone by in which the constant message from the world, and even from some ministers, is this: that\nlove means making much of man. And so when men, with this\nassurance, ponder what your love might mean, they say the same:\nGod’s love means making much of man. For proof they ask: Don’t\nyou feel loved when someone calls attention to your worth?\nI answer: Once I did. When life was better than the Lord, and\nnot the other way around. There was a time love felt like this—\nwhen I could not conceive of any joy greater than the honor of\nmy name. When I was so absorbed in me that it was inconceivable\nfor joy to rise by my admiring rather than my being admired. Oh,\nyes, I’ve known what it is like to call the praise of men an act of\nlove and justify this craving with the readiness to give the same.\nHow satisfying it does seem—this love among ourselves of mutual\nadmiration!\nBut now (thanks to your mighty grace!) I see it is an imitation.\nIt has its roots in Eden long ago. The great destroyer of our love\nand joy said to our mother, Eve, “God knows that when you eat\nof it, your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God” (Gen.\n3:5). Like God! She should have said, “I am like God already.” She\nshould have seen the trick. But she did not, and oh, how many do\nnot see it yet today! She was indeed like God! You made her so—\nyour very image-bearer. Her calling and her high design was this:\nto image forth her Maker’s majesty, and with her joy and trust,\n\n\fMy Prayer—Let None Say in the End, “I’ve Wasted It”\n\n[PAGE 173]\n\nmake much of you. But then the evil thought was sown: “I could\nbe like him in another way. I could be one whose majesty is seen,\nand love might be defined as making much of me.”\nAnd so it came into the world, this great inversion we call\nsin. And love was made to stand now on its head. I grieve, Lord,\njust to put it into words, but here it is with shame: Your love no\nlonger means that you do what you must do to make yourself our\njoy. It has come to mean that you do what you must do so we can\nfeel our worth. It was a sad exchange. And doubly so: Not only\ndid it rob our souls of that one joy that you designed to satisfy\nus for eternity, but worse, it robbed you of your honored place as\nTreasure of our lives.\nAnd everything you’ve done since that dark day in Eden is\ndesigned to set things right. Oh, what a history of deeds and revelations you have wrought to make yourself the center of our joy\nand take back for yourself the place of honor in the world—to be\nthe One your people treasure more than life. How many ways you\nsaid and showed, “I made you for my glory. I made you for my\npraise. I made you for my honor and my name.” And, lest we miss\nthe point, you added: “In my presence there is fullness of joy; at\nmy right hand are pleasures forevermore. Delight yourself in me!\nBe glad in me and leap for joy; I am your sure and great Reward!\nCome taste, and even now rejoice with joy unspeakable and full\nof glory.”\nOh, what a grand design! To make our joy the echo of your\nexcellence. To make our pleasure proof that you now hold the\nplace of Treasure in our lives. To make the gladness of our souls\nthe essence of our worship, and the mirror of your worth. To\nmake yourself most glorified in us, oh, God, when we are satisfied\nin you. How could I, Lord, have ever been so blind to think that\nbeing loved by you means making much of me and not yourself?\nHow could I put my eye to some great telescope, designed to make\nme glad with visions of the galaxies, and notice in the glass a dim\nreflection of my face and say, “Now I am happy, I am loved”?\n\n[PAGE 174]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\nHow could I stand before the setting sun, between the mountain\nrange and the vastness of the sea, and think that everlasting joy\nshould come from making much of me?\nNo, Father, love is this: At great expense you made yourself\nmy glory and my boast. The cost was infinite by which you made\nyourself the Treasure of my life. You sent your Son, the blazing\ncenter of your beauty and your love. You gave him up to mockery,\nbetrayal, thorns, the whip, the rod, the fists, the nails, the shame,\nand death. For what? To swallow up your wrath, and satisfy your\nrighteousness, and bury all my sins as far as east is from the west\nand in the deepest sea, so that I might come home and see the\ngalaxy. This is your love, oh, God, not to make much of me, but\ndo whatever must be done so that I waken to the joy of making\nmuch of you through all eternity.\nHow then shall Christ not be my only boast! Not only that he\nbought yourself for me, oh, God, but is himself your perfect image\nand the blazing center of your radiance. What do I have that does\nnot come from him? What gift of life or breath? What promise\never made did not receive its Yes in him? What one sweet thing—\nor hard thing you will soon make sweet—did I receive except that\nit was purchased by his blood? Not one thing I deserve, but hell.\nYet everything is mine in him, and by his sacrifice alone. Oh, God,\nforbid that I should ever boast save in the cross of Christ, my Lord.\nAnd now shall we who treasure Christ and know your love is\nbetter far than life lay up, like all the world, our treasures on this\nearth? Would not we hear you say, as you once said, “Fool, will\nnot this same night your soul be taken back? And then whose will\nthese barns of bounty be?” Forbid, oh, Lord, that while the world\nis filled with need we would sit down and say, “Soul, you have\nample goods laid up for many years; relax, eat, drink, be merry.”\nA terrible reversal awaits such lovelessness. “Woe to you who\nare rich, for you have received your consolation” (Luke 6:24).\nWe tremble at the words you spoke once to the heartless rich:\n“Remember in your lifetime you received good things, and that\n\n\fMy Prayer—Let None Say in the End, “I’ve Wasted It”\n\n[PAGE 175]\n\npoor man, beside your door, received the pain; but now the great\nreversal comes, and he has comfort here, while you lie there in\nanguish.”\nOh, God, such riches are a wasted life. Protect us, Lord. Grant\nus to hear and heed another call: “Lay up your treasure not on\nearth, but in the place where moth and thief will never come.\nMake treasures for yourself that cannot fail.” But then we ask,\n“What treasures, Lord?” We see you smile. “I am your Treasure\nand your great Reward. I am your food, your drink, your festal\ngarments and your everlasting gain. I am your life and your allsatisfying Joy.”\nYes, Lord. That is enough. But we would ask, How shall we\nlay this treasure up? Is it not laid there by your grace alone and\nbought now once for all by Jesus’s blood? How shall we make\nthis life—this brief and only life that we now live—a laying up of\ntreasure there in heaven? To answer this, you know, oh, God, that\nI have written this small book. And I have looked not to myself or\nlistened to some voice. But I have tried to probe your written Word\nand say what you have said. That is my only claim to truth—that\nI have echoed what you wrote.\nThe answer is that in this life we may begin to treasure Christ,\nand here gain, as it were, an aptitude for joy in him. A greater\nweight of glory waits to be enjoyed for those who grow in love to\nChrist. And what is love to Christ? It is the cherishing of all you\nare for us in him. It is the treasuring of his perfection over all the\ntreasures of the world. It is delighting in his fellowship beyond all\nfamily and friends. It is embracing all his promises that there will\nbe more pleasure in his presence than from all the lying promises\nof sin. It is a gladness in the present taste of glory and the hope\nof future fullness when we see him face to face. It is a quiet peace\nalong the path he chooses for us with its pain. It is a being satisfied\nthat nothing comes to us in vain.\nThere is a quiet kind of joy, oh, Lord, that Jesus did both save\nus from our sin and show us how to love. His life, as you have\n\n[PAGE 176]\n\nDon’t Waste Your Life\n\nsaid, was both a purchase and a path. He died for us, and now\ncalls us to die with him. He took our poverty upon himself that\nwe, in him, might have the riches of his heaven, and he calls us\nnow to use our riches for the poor. He did not count equality with\nyou a thing to grasp, but made himself of no account and crossed\nan endless chasm between heaven and earth, so we might see what\nfrontier missions means and join him in the final task. Is not this,\nthen, the way we lay up treasure in your house—to give our money\nand ourselves to make as many rich with God forever as we can?\nA quiet kind of joy, I say, because of so much suffering. I cannot rise above the great apostle Paul who called his life a daily\ndeath and put it in a paradox: “sorrowful, yet always rejoicing;\nas poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, yet possessing\neverything” (2 Cor. 6:10). Oh Father, grant your church to love\nyour glory more than gold—to cease her love affair with comfort\nand security. Grant that we seek the kingdom first and let the\nother things come as you will. Grant that we move toward need\nand not toward ease. Grant that the firm finality of our security\nin Christ free us to risk our homes and health and money on the\nearth. Help us to see that if we try to guard our wealth, instead\nof using it to show it’s not our god, then we will waste our lives,\nhowever we succeed.\nDear Lord, I tremble now to pray for readers what I barely\nfeel myself. But I have tasted what our life might be if I, and they,\ncould walk along the ever-present edge of death, and smile with\nutter confidence that if we fell, or possibly were pushed, it would\nbe gain. Oh, what abandon, what great liberty, what invincible\nresolve to love would be our portion if we walked this way! What\nreadiness to suffer for the glory of Christ! What eagerness to show\nthe poor that we would gladly spend and be spent to make them\nglad in God for all eternity! What lowliness and meekness and\nfreedom from the need for praise and pay! All things are ours in\nChrist—the world, life, death, the present, the future. All are ours,\nand we are Christ’s. And none of it deserved.",

      "content": "My Prayer—Let None Say in the End, “I’ve Wasted It”\n\n[PAGE 177]\n\nAnd so, dear Lord, I dare to pray that everything I’ve written\nin this book, if it be true, explode with fear-defeating joy in Jesus\nChrist. Let every wavering heart remember this: you promised,\n“I will never leave you nor forsake you” (Heb. 13:5). So may we\nsay with death-defying confidence, “The Lord is my helper; I will\nnot fear; what can man do to me?” (Heb. 13:6).\nForbid that any, Lord, who read these words would have to\nsay someday, “I’ve wasted it.” But grant, by your almighty Spirit\nand your piercing Word, that we who name Christ as the Lord\nwould treasure him above our lives, and feel, deep in our souls,\nthat Christ is life and death is gain. And so may we display his\nworth for all to see. And by our prizing him may he be praised in\nall the world. May he be magnified in life and death. May every\nneighborhood and nation see how joy in Jesus frees his people\nfrom the power of greed and fear.\nLet love flow from your saints, and may it, Lord, be this: that\neven if it costs our lives, the people will be glad in God. “Let the\npeoples praise you, O God; let all the peoples praise you! Let the\nnations be glad and sing for joy” (Ps. 67:3 – 4). Take your honored\nplace, oh, Christ, as the all-satisfying Treasure of the world. With\ntrembling hands before the throne of God, and utterly dependent\non your grace, we lift our voice and make this solemn vow: as God\nlives, and is all I ever need, I will not waste my life . . .\nthrough Jesus Christ, amen.\n\n\f\fGeneral Index\n\nAbednego, 77–78\nAbishai, 76, 78\nAltizer, Thomas J.
