# Preface

Believe it or not, Bob Dylan figures into this story. The reason I mention Dylan here is that between the first publication of this book (2003) and now (2017), he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. Astonishing. The Nobel Prize website says the prize was “for having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition.”

There is tension between the Dylan in my story and the Dylan of the Nobel Prize acceptance speech. After telling us about how the classics Moby-Dick, All Quiet on the Western Front, and The Odyssey shaped his work, Dylan asks, “So what does it all mean?” I sat up with expectation. That’s what this book is about. What does life mean?

Then he answers, “[My songs] can mean a lot of different things. If a song moves you, that’s all that’s important. I don’t have to know what a song means. . . . And I’m not going to worry about it—what it all means.”

If that strikes you as heroic, or courageous, or authentic, you may not like this book, at least not at first. Because it strikes me as tragic. Seventy-six years is a lot of life from which to conclude, “I’m not going to worry about what it all means. If you are moved, that’s all that’s important.” No Mr. D., in a world of suffering like ours, and in the face of death and eternity, “being moved” is not enough.

This book is about a kind of joy that never ends. But the peculiar twist is that this joy makes God look like the supreme Treasure that he is. The unwasted life is based on the discovery that our deepest joy and God’s beautiful majesty reach their apex together.

There is a warning. The path of God-exalting joy will cost you your life. Jesus said, “Whoever loses his life for my sake and the gospel’s will save it” (Mark 8:35). In other words, it is better to lose your life than to waste it.

If you live gladly to make others glad in God, your life will be hard, your risks will be high, and your joy will be full. This is not a book about how to avoid a wounded life, but how to avoid a wasted life. Some of you will die in the service of Christ. That will not be a tragedy. Treasuring life above Christ is a tragedy.

I hope I am wrong about Bob Dylan. When he says, “I’m not going to worry about what it all means,” maybe he really means, “I’m not going to worry, because I have discovered life’s great meaning, and I don’t need to worry anymore.” Maybe he really does believe “The answer is blowin’ in the wind.” The answer. You’ll see how that song figured into my story. It did not lead me to believe that there is no answer.

Please know that I am praying for you, whether you are a student dreaming something radical for your life or whether you are retired and hoping not to waste the final years. If you wonder what I am praying, read chapter 10. It is my prayer.

For now, I thank God for you. My joy grows with every soul that seeks the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. Remember, you have one life. That’s all. You were made for God. Don’t waste it.
