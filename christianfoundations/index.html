                    <p>On a sheet of paper, draw a simple timeline of your spiritual journey, like a line graph that goes up for your high points and down for your low points. Include about 6-8 highs and lows. At each point, write a date or your age and a couple words to describe what happened (for example: a key event, a person who influenced you, or a place that shaped you).</p>
                    <p>Put a star where you became a follower of Christ.</p>
                    <p>When you're done, take a photo of your timeline and bring it to your first meeting.</p>

                <p>The term "salvation" describes deliverance, rescue, and redemption from spiritual bondage and the consequences of sin. It encompasses being saved from separation from God and instead being reconciled with God and granted eternal life.</p>
                
                <div class="verse">
                    <strong>John 3:16-17</strong> For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him.

                    <p><strong>B - Believe Jesus as Savior</strong> - He died for our sins to save us</p>
                    <div class="verse">Romans 5:8 but God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.</div>

                <p>Christian baptism is the immersion of a believer in water in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. It symbolizes the believer's faith in a crucified, buried, and risen Savior.</p>
                
                <div class="verse">
                    <strong>Romans 6:3-4</strong> All of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life.

                <p>When you become a Christian by putting your faith in Jesus as Lord and Savior, you are a new creation. You have been adopted by the Father into the family of God.</p>
                
                <div class="verse">
                    <strong>2 Corinthians 5:17,21</strong> Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come...For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.

                <h3 style="color: #3498db; font-size: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">What is Prayer?</h3>
                <p>Prayer is a conversation: talking with and listening to God. Prayer displays our dependence on a powerful and loving Father. Jesus taught us to pray in the Lord's Prayer, giving us a pattern with a humble heart.</p>
                
                <div class="verse">
                    <strong>The Lord's Prayer</strong><br>
                    Our Father, who is in heaven,<br>
                    Holy is your name,<br>
                    your kingdom come, your will be done<br>

                    Forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who sin against us.<br>
                    And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.<br>

                <h3 style="color: #3498db; font-size: 1.3rem; margin: 2rem 0 1rem 0;">STEP 1 - CONNECT RELATIONALLY</h3>
                <p><em>"Our Father, who is in heaven"</em></p>
                <p>God has adopted us as His children and loves for us to call Him our Father. Starting prayer by acknowledging our relationship with God is powerful for us and delights Him.</p>

                <p><em>"Holy is your name"</em></p>
                <p>When we proclaim who He is, we worship Him by reminding ourselves how powerful and great our God is. He is love, grace, and forgiveness.</p>

                <div class="question">3.3 - What are some names and attributes of God you can proclaim in your prayers to honor Him?</div>

                <h3 style="color: #3498db; font-size: 1.3rem; margin: 2rem 0 1rem 0;">STEP 3 - PRAY HIS AGENDA FIRST</h3>
                <p><em>"your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven"</em></p>
                <p>Part of being a child of God is caring about what He cares about. We acknowledge His wisdom and sovereignty when we pray His agenda first.</p>

                <div class="question">3.4 - What are some things that God cares about that you could pray about?</div>

                <h3 style="color: #3498db; font-size: 1.3rem; margin: 2rem 0 1rem 0;">STEP 4 - DEPEND ON HIM FOR EVERYTHING</h3>
                <p><em>"Give us this day our daily bread."</em></p>
                <p>God promises to supply all our needs. He wants us to come to Him with our problems, needs, and desires and to trust Him to provide.</p>

                <div class="question">3.5 - What are some of your current needs that you want God to provide for?</div>

                <p><em>"Forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who sin against us."</em></p>
                <p>God has offered us complete forgiveness. When we receive His forgiveness, our hearts are more prepared to forgive others as well.</p>

                <div class="question">3.6 - How does God's forgiveness help us forgive others?</div>
                <textarea class="response-box" id="question-3-6" placeholder="How does forgiveness work?" data-question="3.6 - Forgiveness connection"></textarea>

                <p><em>"And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil."</em></p>
                <p>We have an enemy trying to steal, kill, and destroy. As we pray, we take our stand against the enemy and fight from victory through Jesus.</p>

                <h3 style="color: #3498db; font-size: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">What is the Bible?</h3>
                <p>The Bible is the Word of God to humanity, to be our guide, to instruct, and to bring us into relationship with Him. It serves as a road map for our spiritual journey, helping us understand God's character, the purpose of our lives, and the principles we should live by.</p>
                
                <div class="verse">
                    <strong>2 Timothy 3:16-17</strong> All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.

                <h3 style="color: #3498db; font-size: 1.3rem; margin: 2rem 0 1rem 0;">The Bible should be: 1) Read Daily, 2) Studied, 3) Obeyed</h3>
                
                <h4 style="color: #2c3e50; margin: 1.5rem 0 1rem 0;">1) The Bible should be "Read Daily"</h4>
                <p>The way we get to know someone is through conversation. When we read about God's journey, desires, and character, we begin to understand Him, which leads to an authentic relationship. God desires for us to know Him through His story from creation to the New Testament.</p>

                <h4 style="color: #2c3e50; margin: 1.5rem 0 1rem 0;">2) The Bible should be "Studied"</h4>
                <p>Reading is essential, but we must also dig deep and study it. Through study, we uncover cultural context, historical background, and the original intent. A great way to move from reading to deeper study is by asking these 2 key questions:</p>
                <p><strong>1) What does this passage tell me about God?</strong> - Learn about God<br>
                <strong>2) What does this passage tell me about mankind?</strong> - Learn about people</p>

                <p style="margin: 1.5rem 0;"><strong>Let's study John 8:2-11:</strong></p>
                <div class="verse">
                    <strong>John 8:2-11</strong> Early in the morning (Jesus) he came again to the temple. All the people came to him, and he sat down and taught them. The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery, and placing her in the midst they said to him, "Teacher, this woman has been caught in the act of adultery. Now in the Law, Moses commanded us to stone such women. So what do you say?" This they said to test him, that they might have some charge to bring against him. Jesus bent down and wrote with his finger on the ground. And as they continued to ask him, he stood up and said to them, "Let him who is without sin among you be the first to throw a stone at her." And once more he bent down and wrote on the ground. But when they heard it, they went away one by one, beginning with the older ones, and Jesus was left alone with the woman standing before him. Jesus stood up and said to her, "Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?" She said, "No one, Lord." And Jesus said, "Neither do I condemn you; go, and from now on sin no more."

                <p>Jesus tells us in Matthew 7:24 "Everyone then who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock." True faith involves putting belief into action.</p>
                
                <p>The third question we can ask ourselves is:<br>
                <strong>3) What is the passage telling me to do or believe?</strong> - "Because of this truth I will..."</p>

                <div class="question">4.5 - What is the passage John 8:2-11 telling me to do or believe? What is the next step I will take? Because of this truth, I will...</div>

                <h3 style="color: #3498db; font-size: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">What is the Church?</h3>
                <p>The Church is the "Body of Christ". We are a connected family of believers that continues the mission and message of Jesus. God sent the Holy Spirit to empower and unify the church around the Gospel.</p>
                
                <div class="verse">
                    <strong>Ephesians 1:22-23</strong> And he (God the Father) put all things under his (Jesus') feet and gave him as head over all things to the church, which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all.

                <div class="verse">
                    <strong>John 13:34-35</strong> So now I am giving you a new commandment: Love each other. Just as I have loved you, you should love each other. Your love for one another will prove to the world that you are my disciples. ~Jesus

                    <strong>Acts 2:42-47</strong> And they devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers. And awe came upon every soul, and many wonders and signs were being done through the apostles. And all who believed were together and had all things in common. And they were selling their possessions and belongings and distributing the proceeds to all, as any had need. And day by day, attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes, they received their food with glad and generous hearts, praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to their number day by day those who were being saved.

                <h4 style="color: #2c3e50; margin: 1.5rem 0 1rem 0;">2) The Church Equips</h4>
                <p>The early church devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching. Just as Jesus equipped His disciples through both word and deed, the Church provides Biblical teaching alongside practical examples of living out the faith.</p>

                <div class="question">5.4 - In what ways have you been equipped by the church to live out your faith? What are some areas you would like more equipping?</div>

                <p>The early church was active in the community, selling possessions to help those in need. After Jesus washed the disciples' feet, He said in John 13:14-15 "If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet. For I have given you an example, that you also should do just as I have done to you."</p>

                <h3 style="color: #3498db; font-size: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">What is Evangelism?</h3>
                <p>Following Jesus includes not only personal spiritual growth but also sharing and offering the gospel to others. Each Christian is called by Jesus to make disciples where they live, work, play, and learn. This is your ministry.</p>
                
                <p>Your "Personal Ministry" is sharing the Gospel with people you know and random people you meet so they too can have a saving relationship with Jesus. Successful evangelism is the sharing of the Good News, and it is not dependent on the person's response.</p>

                <div class="question">6.1 - If you had to score yourself from 1-10 on having spiritual conversations with others who are not Christian, what number would you be and why?</div>

                <h4 style="color: #2c3e50; margin: 1.5rem 0 1rem 0;">1) Care</h4>
                <p>When we care, we create a foundation of trust and openness, making the Gospel more receptive. People don't care how much you know until they know how much you care. To truly love our neighbors as ourselves, we should care about their well-being now and into eternity.</p>

                <div class="question">6.3 - What are some ways you could care for those in your life who are not yet followers of Jesus?</div>

                <p>We should talk to God about people before we talk to people about God. Prayer aligns our hearts with God's and invites His presence and power into our efforts. Prayer prepares the soil of hearts we are sowing into.</p>

                <div class="question">6.4 - How can you add praying for the lost to your daily quiet time?</div>

                <h4 style="color: #2c3e50; margin: 1.5rem 0 1rem 0;">3) Share</h4>
                <p>Sharing the Gospel is the central act of evangelism, where we verbally communicate the good news of Jesus Christ. This often involves our personal story.</p>
                
                <div class="verse">
                    <strong>Romans 10:14-15</strong> How then will they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how are they to believe in him of whom they have never heard? And how are they to hear without someone preaching? And how are they to preach unless they are sent? As it is written, "How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the good news!"
                </div>

                <p><strong>Roman Road - ABC's of the Gospel:</strong></p>
                <p><strong>A - Admit</strong> you are a sinner and need a Savior. (Romans 3:23)<br>
                <strong>B - Believe</strong> in Jesus as your Savior, His death and resurrection. (Romans 10:9)<br>
                <strong>C - Confess</strong> Jesus as your Lord. (Romans 10:9)</p>

                <p>The final step is offering salvation through faith in Jesus Christ. This involves:</p>
                <p><strong>1. A Question:</strong> "Do you want to accept Jesus as Savior and Lord?"<br>
                <strong>2. A Prayer:</strong> Guide them in a salvation prayer<br>
                <strong>3. An Encouragement:</strong> "Welcome to the family of God. Let's stay connected."</p>

                <p>Our final session focuses on living a life of repentance. We have learned that we must repent to be saved, but this is not the only time we will need to repent. When someone becomes a Christian, they begin a life of repentance.</p>

                <p><strong>Repentance = A change of attitude and action from sin toward obedience to God.</strong> Repentance involves remorse of the heart that leads to right actions.</p>

                    <strong>Hebrews 12:1-2</strong> Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight, and sin which clings so closely, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God.
