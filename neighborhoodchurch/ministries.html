                <h2>Kids Growing Up Together</h2>
                <p>Our Neighborhood Kids Ministry encourages kids to know they are deeply loved by God, to grow in their
                    love for Him, and to learn how to love others together. In a safe, fun, and age-appropriate
                    environment, kids from nursery through 5th grade experience creative Bible teaching, fun activities,
                    and meaningful relationships with caring leaders and friends.</p>
                <p>We believe these early years shape a kid’s identity and faith for a lifetime. Our heart is for kids
                    to be satisfied in who they are in Christ, knowing they are loved by God and their church family. We
                    help kids understand they can be a blessing to others and that they belong in the family of God.</p>
                <p>Our volunteers are background-checked, well trained, and passionate about walking alongside kids as
                    they grow into confident followers of Jesus, blessing others where they live, learn, and play, and
                    experiencing true belonging in God’s family.</p>

                <p>Middle school and high school are some of the most foundational years and we hope students navigate
                    them with each other and with God! Our Youth Group (NCYG) is a place where teens can ask hard
                    questions, build genuine friendships, and discover what it means to follow Jesus for themselves as
                    we
                    open God's Word together.</p>
                <p>Through weekly youth group, Sunday morning Bible study, summer camp trips, and service trips and a
                    whole lot of fun, we hope to help guide the next generation as they grow into who God created them
                    to
                    be.</p>

                <p>High school is over, but real life is just beginning. The young adult years — from graduation to
                    your early twenties — are full of huge decisions, big questions, and new freedoms. We don't want you
                    navigating this season alone. Our Young Adults Group is a community where you can find authentic
                    friendships, ask honest questions about faith, and discover what it looks like to follow Jesus in
                    college, career, and everything in between.</p>
                <p>Through regular gatherings, game nights, service opportunities, and real conversations, we're
                    building
                    forever friendships rooted in something deeper than shared interests or life stage. We're learning
                    together what it means to love God and love our neighbors as we step into adulthood.</p>

                    table for you.</p>
                <p>Through Bible studies, fellowship events, and intentional discipleship, we create space for women to

                <p>At Neighborhood Church, serving isn't just something we do on Sundays — it's part of who we are.
                    Our Serve Teams are the backbone of our church family, making everything from Sunday mornings to
                    community outreach possible. Serving is also one of the fastest ways to build real friendships and
                    feel like you belong.</p>
                <p>We have teams for hospitality, setup and teardown, kids' ministry helpers, parking, greeting, audio
                    and visual tech, and community outreach. No matter your skill set or schedule, there's a team that
                    could use you.</p>
